# Review Documentation Command

You're reviewing documentation quality. This command dispatches the ring-tw-team:docs-reviewer agent.

## Review Process

The review covers five dimensions:

### 1. Voice and Tone
- Uses "you" not "users"
- Present tense for current behavior
- Active voice (subject does action)
- Assertive but not arrogant
- Sounds like helping a colleague

### 2. Structure
- Sentence case headings
- Section dividers between major topics
- Scannable (bullets, tables, headings)
- Logical hierarchy

### 3. Completeness
- All sections present
- Examples included
- Links work
- Next steps provided

### 4. Clarity
- Short sentences (one idea)
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- Jargon explained
- Realistic examples

### 5. Technical Accuracy
- Facts are correct
- Code examples work
- Links valid
- Version info current
