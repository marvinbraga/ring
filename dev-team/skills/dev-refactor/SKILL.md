  Analyzes existing codebase against standards to identify gaps in architecture, code quality,
  testing, and DevOps. Auto-detects project language and uses appropriate agent standards
  (Go, TypeScript, Frontend, DevOps, SRE). Generates refactoring tasks.md compatible with dev-cycle.

trigger: |
  - User wants to refactor existing project to follow standards
  - User runs /ring-dev-team:dev-refactor command
  - Legacy codebase needs modernization
  - Project audit requested

skip_when: |
  - Greenfield project → Use /ring-pm-team:pre-dev-* instead
  - Single file fix → Use ring-dev-team:dev-cycle directly

This skill analyzes an existing codebase to identify gaps between current implementation and project standards, then generates a structured refactoring plan compatible with the dev-cycle workflow.

---

## ⛔ STEP 0: PROJECT_RULES.md VALIDATION (EXECUTE FIRST)

**THIS IS THE FIRST ACTION. Execute BEFORE reading any other section.**

### Validation Sequence

```text
1. Check: Does docs/PROJECT_RULES.md exist?
   └── YES → Continue to "HARD GATES" section below
   └── NO  → OUTPUT BLOCKER AND TERMINATE (see below)
```

### If File Does Not Exist → MANDATORY BLOCKER OUTPUT

**⛔ You MUST output this EXACT response and TERMINATE immediately:**

```markdown
## ⛔ HARD BLOCK: PROJECT_RULES.md Not Found

**Status:** BLOCKED - Cannot proceed with analysis

### What Was Checked
- ❌ `docs/PROJECT_RULES.md` - Not found

### Why This Is a Hard Gate
PROJECT_RULES.md defines the project's specific standards, architecture decisions,
and conventions. Without it, there is NO baseline to compare against.

**Analysis without standards = meaningless comparison.**

### What This Agent CANNOT Do
- ❌ Use "default best practices" as a substitute
- ❌ Infer standards from existing code patterns
- ❌ Proceed with partial analysis
- ❌ Use Ring standards alone (they complement, not replace project rules)

### Required Action
The project owner must create `docs/PROJECT_RULES.md` defining:
- Architecture patterns (hexagonal, clean, DDD, etc.)
- Code conventions (naming, error handling, logging)
- Testing requirements (coverage thresholds, patterns)
- DevOps standards (containerization, CI/CD)

### Next Steps
1. User creates `docs/PROJECT_RULES.md` manually
2. Re-run `/ring-dev-team:dev-refactor` after file exists

**This skill terminates here. No further analysis will be performed.**
```

### Post-Blocker Behavior (MANDATORY)

After outputting the blocker above:
1. **TERMINATE** - Do not continue to any other step
2. **Do NOT** offer to create PROJECT_RULES.md for the user
3. **Do NOT** suggest workarounds or alternatives
4. **Do NOT** analyze using "default" or "industry" standards

### Gate 0 Rationalizations - DO NOT THINK THESE

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "I'll use default Go/TypeScript best practices" | Best practices ≠ project standards. Every project has unique decisions. | Output blocker, TERMINATE |
| "Existing code shows the patterns to follow" | Existing code may BE the problem. Can't use debt as standard. | Output blocker, TERMINATE |
| "Ring standards are enough" | Ring standards are BASE. PROJECT_RULES.md adds project-specific decisions. | Output blocker, TERMINATE |
| "Code works, so I can infer the standards" | Working ≠ correct. Inference = guessing = wrong analysis. | Output blocker, TERMINATE |
| "Small project doesn't need formal standards" | Small projects grow. Standards prevent debt accumulation. | Output blocker, TERMINATE |
| "User didn't ask for standards, just analysis" | Analysis requires baseline. No baseline = no analysis possible. | Output blocker, TERMINATE |
| "I can analyze and recommend standards later" | Recommend against what baseline? Analysis is meaningless without reference. | Output blocker, TERMINATE |

---

## ⛔ STEP 1.5: AGENT DISPATCH VALIDATION (HARD GATE - EXECUTE BEFORE ANY DISPATCH)

**THIS IS A HARD GATE. Violation = SKILL FAILURE. Execute BEFORE calling ANY Task tool.**

### Validation Sequence

```text
1. Check: Does subagent_type start with "ring-dev-team:" ?
   └── YES → Continue with dispatch
   └── NO  → STOP IMMEDIATELY. DO NOT DISPATCH. (see below)
```

### If Agent Does NOT Have "ring-dev-team:" Prefix → MANDATORY STOP

**⛔ You MUST NOT dispatch the agent. This is a HARD GATE.**

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⛔ HARD GATE: AGENT PREFIX VALIDATION                              │
│                                                                     │
│  subagent_type MUST start with "ring-dev-team:"                     │

│  ✅ "ring-dev-team:..." → ALLOWED - proceed with dispatch           │
│  ❌ ANYTHING ELSE       → FORBIDDEN - DO NOT DISPATCH               │
│                                                                     │
│  This is NOT optional. This is NOT a suggestion.                    │
│  This is a MANDATORY HARD GATE.                                     │
│                                                                     │
│  Dispatching an agent without "ring-dev-team:" prefix = SKILL FAILURE│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why This Is a Hard Gate (NOT Optional)

**Agents without `ring-dev-team:` prefix CANNOT perform this skill's function:**

| Capability | ring-dev-team:* | Other agents |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| WebFetch for Ring standards | ✅ HAS | ❌ LACKS |
| Domain expertise built-in | ✅ HAS | ❌ LACKS |
| Standards-based compliance output | ✅ HAS | ❌ LACKS |

**Using other agents = Analysis against NOTHING = INVALID output = SKILL FAILURE.**

This is not about preference. Other agents are **technically incapable** of performing standards-based analysis.

### Post-Check Behavior (MANDATORY)

**If the agent you're about to dispatch does NOT have `ring-dev-team:` prefix:**

1. **DO NOT DISPATCH** - Stop before calling Task tool
2. **SELECT CORRECT AGENT** - Find appropriate `ring-dev-team:*` agent
3. **VERIFY PREFIX** - Confirm it starts with `ring-dev-team:`
4. **THEN DISPATCH** - Only after verification passes

**There is NO workaround. There is NO alternative. There is NO exception.**

### Violation Recovery (If You Already Made a Mistake)

**If you ALREADY dispatched an agent without `ring-dev-team:` prefix:**

1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** - Do not continue using its output
2. **DISCARD THE OUTPUT** - It is INVALID (lacks standards knowledge)
3. **RE-DISPATCH** - Use appropriate `ring-dev-team:*` agent
4. **DOCUMENT** - Note: "Recovered from incorrect agent dispatch"

**Output from non-ring-dev-team agents is INVALID and MUST NOT be used.**

### Gate 1.5 Rationalizations - DO NOT THINK THESE

**If you catch yourself thinking ANY of these, STOP. You are about to violate a HARD GATE:**

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "This other agent is faster" | Speed is IRRELEVANT. Wrong agent = INVALID output. | STOP. Use `ring-dev-team:*` |
| "I'll explore first, then use specialists" | Exploration with wrong agent = wasted time + INVALID data. | STOP. Use `ring-dev-team:*` directly |
| "I need to understand the code first" | ring-dev-team:* agents understand AND analyze. One step. | STOP. Use `ring-dev-team:*` |
| "These agents are similar enough" | Similar ≠ equivalent. They LACK standards loading. | STOP. Use `ring-dev-team:*` |
| "Just this once won't matter" | Once = SKILL FAILURE. No exceptions exist. | STOP. Use `ring-dev-team:*` |
| "I can use the output anyway" | Output without standards = GARBAGE IN. | STOP. Discard. Re-dispatch. |
| "The user won't notice" | The USER defined this gate. Violation = failure. | STOP. Use `ring-dev-team:*` |
| "It's close enough" | Close ≠ correct. HARD GATE means EXACT match required. | STOP. Use `ring-dev-team:*` |

---

## ⛔ HARD GATES - READ AFTER STEP 0 PASSES

**This skill has TWO mandatory hard gates. Violation of either gate is a SKILL FAILURE.**

### Gate 1: PROJECT_RULES.md (Prerequisite) ✓

**Already validated in Step 0 above.** If you reached this section, PROJECT_RULES.md exists.

### Gate 2: Agent Dispatch (Execution) - HARD GATE

**⛔ THIS IS A HARD GATE. Violation = SKILL FAILURE.**

**⛔ MANDATORY:** ALL agents MUST have `ring-dev-team:` prefix. NO EXCEPTIONS.

**⛔ See "STEP 1.5: AGENT DISPATCH VALIDATION" above for complete validation sequence, mandatory behavior, and rationalizations to avoid.**

#### Parallel Dispatch (Step 3)

**ALL applicable ring-dev-team:* agents MUST be dispatched in a SINGLE message (parallel execution).**

Select agents based on the analysis dimensions needed for the task. Dispatch ALL that apply.

#### Violations - STOP IMMEDIATELY (HARD GATE VIOLATIONS)

| Violation | Consequence | Required Action |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Using agent without `ring-dev-team:` prefix | **SKILL FAILURE** - Output is INVALID | STOP. Discard output. Re-dispatch with `ring-dev-team:*` |
| Dispatching agents sequentially | Wastes time, incomplete context | Re-send as SINGLE message with ALL agents |
| Dispatching fewer agents than needed | Incomplete analysis | Add ALL applicable `ring-dev-team:*` agents |
| Reading >3 files directly | Violates 3-file rule | Use `ring-dev-team:*` agents instead |

**If you already violated a gate:** STOP IMMEDIATELY. Discard invalid output. Re-execute with correct agents. There is NO way to salvage output from wrong agents.

### Pressure Resistance - DO NOT RATIONALIZE

**If you catch yourself thinking ANY of these, STOP immediately:**

#### Agent & Execution Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "This other agent is faster" | Speed ≠ correctness. Wrong agent = wrong analysis. | Use `ring-dev-team:*` agent |
| "I'll just read the files directly" | Violates 3-file rule, incomplete analysis | Dispatch `ring-dev-team:*` agents |
| "One agent is enough" | Multiple dimensions require multiple specialized agents | Dispatch ALL applicable in parallel |
| "Sequential dispatch is fine" | Wastes time, skill requires parallel | Single message, ALL agents |

**Note:** PROJECT_RULES.md rationalizations are covered in "STEP 0: PROJECT_RULES.md VALIDATION" at the top of this skill.

#### Analysis Scope Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Code works fine" | Working ≠ maintainable. Analysis finds hidden debt. | Complete full analysis |
| "Code works, skip analysis" | Working ≠ maintainable. Technical debt hidden. | Complete ALL dimensions |
| "Too time-consuming" | Cost of analysis < cost of compounding debt | Complete full analysis |
| "No time for full analysis" | Partial analysis = partial picture | ALL dimensions required |
| "Standards don't fit us" | Document YOUR standards. Analysis still reveals gaps. | Analyze against project rules |
| "Only critical matters" | Today's medium = tomorrow's critical | Document all severities |
| "Only critical issues matter" | Medium issues become critical over time | Document all, prioritize later |
| "Legacy gets a pass" | Legacy sets precedent. Analysis shows what to improve. | Document all gaps |
| "Standards don't apply to legacy" | Legacy needs analysis MOST | Full analysis required |
| "Team has their own way" | Document "their way" as standards. Analyze against it. | Use PROJECT_RULES.md |
| "That's just how we do it here" | Undocumented patterns = inconsistent patterns | Document in PROJECT_RULES.md |

#### ROI & Justification Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "ROI of refactoring is low" | ROI calculation requires analysis. Can't calculate without data. | Complete analysis first |
| "ROI doesn't justify full analysis" | You can't know ROI without the analysis data | Complete analysis, then evaluate |
| "Partial analysis is enough" | Partial analysis = partial picture. Hidden debt in skipped areas. | ALL dimensions required |
| "Partial analysis is sufficient" | Missing dimensions = missing problems | Complete all dimensions |
| "3 years without bugs = stable" | No bugs ≠ no debt. Time doesn't validate architecture. | Full architecture analysis |
| "3+ years stable = no debt" | Stability ≠ maintainability. Debt compounds silently. | Complete analysis |
| "Analysis is overkill" | Analysis is the MINIMUM. Refactoring without analysis is guessing. | Complete all steps |
| "Code smells ≠ problems" | Code smells ARE problems. They slow development and cause bugs. | Document all findings |
| "Code smells aren't real problems" | Smells indicate deeper issues. They compound over time. | Document all severities |
| "No specific problem motivating" | Technical debt IS the problem. Analysis quantifies it. | Complete analysis |
| "No specific problem to solve" | Unknown problems are still problems. Analysis reveals them. | Full dimension scan |

#### Completion Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Analysis complete, user can decide" | Analysis without action guidance is incomplete. | Generate tasks.md |
| "Analysis is done, user decides next" | Skill requires tasks.md generation | Generate tasks.md before completing |
| "Findings documented, my job done" | Findings → Tasks → Execution. Documentation alone changes nothing. | Generate tasks.md |
| "Documented findings, job complete" | Tasks.md is mandatory output | Complete Step 6 (tasks.md) |

**Non-negotiable:** These gates exist because specialized agents load Ring standards via WebFetch and have domain expertise. Generic agents do NOT have this capability.

### Execution Checklist - MUST COMPLETE IN ORDER

```text
Step 0:   [ ] PROJECT_RULES.md exists? → If NO, output blocker and TERMINATE
           ⚠️ See "STEP 0: PROJECT_RULES.md VALIDATION" at top of skill

Step 1:   [ ] Language detected? → go.mod / package.json found

Step 1.5: [ ] Agent dispatch validated? → BEFORE typing Task tool:
           ⚠️ Does subagent_type start with "ring-dev-team:"? → REQUIRED

Step 2:   [ ] PROJECT_RULES.md read?

Step 3:   [ ] ALL applicable ring-dev-team:* agents dispatched in SINGLE message?
           ⚠️ If wrong agent used → DISCARD output, re-dispatch correct agent

Step 4:   [ ] Agent outputs compiled into analysis-report.md?
Step 5:   [ ] Findings grouped into REFACTOR-XXX tasks?
Step 6:   [ ] tasks.md generated? → If NO, skill is INCOMPLETE
Step 7:   [ ] User approval requested via AskUserQuestion?
Step 8:   [ ] Artifacts saved to docs/refactor/{timestamp}/?
Step 9:   [ ] Handoff to dev-cycle (if approved)?
```

**SKIP PREVENTION:** You CANNOT proceed to Step N+1 without completing Step N. No exceptions.

**Step 0 is NON-NEGOTIABLE:** If PROJECT_RULES.md doesn't exist, you MUST output the blocker template from the top of this skill and terminate. No rationalizations allowed.

**Step 1.5 is NON-NEGOTIABLE:** If subagent_type doesn't start with `ring-dev-team:`, STOP and use the correct agent. No rationalizations allowed.

#### Prompt Prefix (REQUIRED)

All agent prompts MUST start with:
```text
**MODE: ANALYSIS ONLY** - Analyze codebase for refactoring.
Return findings with: severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low), location (file:line), issue, recommendation.
```

#### WRONG vs RIGHT: Agent Dispatch

**❌ WRONG:**

```yaml
# ANY agent without "ring-dev-team:" prefix
- subagent_type: "Explore"           # ❌ WRONG
- subagent_type: "general-purpose"   # ❌ WRONG
- subagent_type: "ring-default:..."  # ❌ WRONG

# Sequential dispatch (multiple separate messages)
# ❌ WRONG - Must be SINGLE message with ALL agents in parallel
```

**✅ RIGHT:**

```yaml
# ALL agents have "ring-dev-team:" prefix
- subagent_type: "ring-dev-team:..."  # ✅ CORRECT

# All dispatched in SINGLE message (parallel)
# All prompts start with **MODE: ANALYSIS ONLY**
# All prompts reference PROJECT_RULES.md
```

**Key rules:**
- ✅ ALL agents MUST have `ring-dev-team:` prefix
- ✅ Dispatch ALL applicable agents in SINGLE message (parallel)
- ✅ ALL prompts start with `**MODE: ANALYSIS ONLY**`
- ✅ ALL prompts reference PROJECT_RULES.md

---

## What This Skill Does

1. **Detects project language** (Go, TypeScript, Python) from manifest files
2. **Reads PROJECT_RULES.md** (project-specific standards - MANDATORY)
3. **Dispatches specialized agents** that load their own Ring standards via WebFetch
4. **Compiles agent findings** into structured analysis report
5. **Generates tasks.md** in the same format as PM Team output
6. **User approves** the plan before execution via dev-cycle

## Foundational Principle

**REFACTORING ANALYSIS IS NOT OPTIONAL FOR CODEBASES WITH TECHNICAL DEBT**

When user requests refactoring or improvement:
1. **NEVER** skip analysis because "code works"
2. **ALWAYS** analyze ALL applicable dimensions
3. **DOCUMENT** all findings, not just critical
4. **PRESERVE** full analysis even if user filters later

**Cost comparison:**
- Cost of refactoring now: Known, bounded
- Cost of compounding debt: Unknown, unbounded

**Analysis now saves 10x effort later.**

## Analysis-to-Action Pipeline - MANDATORY

**Analysis without action guidance is incomplete:**

| Deliverable | Required? | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| analysis-report.md | ✅ YES | Document findings |
| tasks.md | ✅ YES | Convert findings to actionable tasks |
| User approval prompt | ✅ YES | Get explicit decision on execution |

**Analysis completion checklist:**
- [ ] ALL applicable dimensions analyzed
- [ ] Findings categorized by severity
- [ ] Findings converted to REFACTOR-XXX tasks
- [ ] tasks.md generated in PM Team format
- [ ] User presented with approval options

**"Analysis complete" means tasks.md exists and user has been asked to approve.**

**If analysis ends without tasks.md:**
1. Analysis is NOT complete
2. Step 6 (Generate tasks.md) was skipped
3. Return to Step 6 before declaring completion

## Analysis Dimensions - ALL REQUIRED

**Every analysis MUST cover ALL applicable dimensions:**

| Dimension | What It Checks | Skip Allowed? |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Architecture | Patterns, structure, dependencies | ❌ NO |
| Code Quality | Standards compliance, complexity, naming | ❌ NO |
| Testing | Coverage, test quality, TDD compliance | ❌ NO |
| DevOps | Containerization, CI/CD, infrastructure | ❌ NO |

**If user says "only check X":**
- Check X thoroughly
- Check other dimensions briefly
- Report: "Full analysis recommended for dimensions: [Y, Z]"

**NEVER produce partial analysis without noting gaps.**

## Cancellation Documentation - MANDATORY

**If user cancels analysis at approval step:**

1. **ASK:** "Why is analysis being cancelled?"
2. **DOCUMENT:** Save reason to `docs/refactor/{timestamp}/cancelled-reason.md`
3. **PRESERVE:** Keep partial analysis artifacts
4. **NOTE:** "Analysis cancelled by user: [reason]. Partial findings preserved."

**Cancellation without documentation is NOT allowed.**

## Prerequisites

**⛔ See "HARD GATES" section above for mandatory checks.**

Before starting analysis:
1. **Project root identified**: Know where the codebase lives
2. **Language detectable**: Project has go.mod, package.json, or similar manifest
3. **Scope defined**: Full project or specific directories
4. **PROJECT_RULES.md exists**: Gate 1 in HARD GATES section

## Step 0: Verify PROJECT_RULES.md Exists ✓

**⛔ Already covered in "STEP 0: PROJECT_RULES.md VALIDATION" at the top of this skill.**

If you reached this section, validation passed. Proceed to Step 1.

---

## Step 1: Detect Project Language

**⛔ See "HARD GATES" section above - Gate 2 → Agent Selection by Language**

Detect manifest files (`go.mod`, `package.json`) to determine which `ring-dev-team:*` agent to use.

## Step 2: Read PROJECT_RULES.md

**Read the project-specific standards file:**

```text
Action: Use Read tool to load docs/PROJECT_RULES.md

This file contains:
- Project-specific conventions
- Technology stack decisions
- Architecture patterns chosen for THIS project
- Team-specific coding standards
```

**What dev-refactor does NOT do:**
- Does NOT call WebFetch for Ring standards
- Does NOT load golang.md, typescript.md, devops.md, sre.md directly

**Why?** Each specialized agent (devops-engineer, sre, qa-analyst, backend-engineer-*) has its own WebFetch instructions in its agent definition. They load their own standards when dispatched. This avoids duplication and keeps responsibilities clear:

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------------|
| **dev-refactor** | Reads PROJECT_RULES.md (local), dispatches agents, compiles findings |
| **Agents** | Load Ring standards via WebFetch, analyze their dimension, return findings |

**Output of this step:**
- PROJECT_RULES.md content loaded and understood
- Ready to dispatch agents with project context

## Step 3: Scan Codebase

**⛔ See "HARD GATES" section above - Gate 2 → Parallel Dispatch**

Dispatch ALL applicable `ring-dev-team:*` agents in a SINGLE message.

All prompts MUST start with `**MODE: ANALYSIS ONLY**`.

**Output:** Dimension-specific findings with severities to compile in Step 4.

## Step 4: Compile Findings

**Collect outputs from all dispatched agents and merge into structured report.**

Each agent returns findings in their output. The dev-refactor skill must:
1. **Collect** all agent outputs
2. **Parse** findings from each output (severity, location, issue, recommendation)
3. **Deduplicate** overlapping findings
4. **Categorize** by dimension (Architecture, Code Quality, Testing, DevOps)
5. **Sort** by severity (Critical → High → Medium → Low)

**Merge results into structured report:**

```markdown
# Analysis Report: {project-name}

**Generated:** {date}
**Standards:** {path to PROJECT_RULES.md used}
**Scope:** {directories analyzed}

## Summary

| Dimension    | Issues | Critical | High | Medium | Low |

## Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

### ARCH-001: Domain depends on infrastructure
**Location:** `src/domain/user.go:15`
**Issue:** Domain entity imports database package
**Standard:** Domain layer must have zero external dependencies
**Fix:** Extract repository interface, inject via constructor

### CODE-001: SQL injection vulnerability
**Location:** `src/handler/search.go:42`
**Issue:** User input concatenated into SQL query
**Standard:** Always use parameterized queries
**Fix:** Use query builder or prepared statements

## Step 5: Prioritize and Group

Group related issues into logical refactoring tasks:

```text
Grouping Strategy:
1. By bounded context / module
2. By dependency order (fix dependencies first)
3. By risk (critical security first)

Example grouping:
├── REFACTOR-001: Fix domain layer isolation
│   ├── ARCH-001: Remove infra imports from domain
│   ├── ARCH-003: Extract repository interfaces
│   └── ARCH-005: Move domain events to domain layer
│
├── REFACTOR-002: Implement proper error handling
│   ├── CODE-002: Wrap errors with context (15 locations)
│   ├── CODE-007: Replace panic with error returns
│   └── CODE-012: Add custom domain error types
│
├── REFACTOR-003: Add missing test coverage
│   ├── TEST-001: User service unit tests
│   ├── TEST-002: Order handler tests
│   └── TEST-003: Repository integration tests
│
└── REFACTOR-004: Containerization improvements
    ├── DEVOPS-001: Add multi-stage Dockerfile
    └── DEVOPS-002: Create docker-compose.yml
```

## Step 6: Generate tasks.md

Create refactoring tasks in the same format as PM Team output:

```markdown
# Refactoring Tasks: {project-name}

**Source:** Analysis Report {date}
**Total Tasks:** {count}
**Estimated Effort:** {total hours}

## REFACTOR-001: Fix domain layer isolation

**Type:** backend
**Effort:** 4h
**Priority:** Critical
**Dependencies:** none

### Description
Remove infrastructure dependencies from domain layer and establish proper
port/adapter boundaries following hexagonal architecture.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AC-1: Domain package has zero imports from infrastructure
- [ ] AC-2: Repository interfaces defined in domain layer
- [ ] AC-3: All domain entities use dependency injection
- [ ] AC-4: Existing tests still pass

### Technical Notes
- Files to modify: src/domain/*.go
- Pattern: See PROJECT_RULES.md → Hexagonal Architecture section
- Related issues: ARCH-001, ARCH-003, ARCH-005

### Issues Addressed
| ID | Description | Location |
|----|-------------|----------|
| ARCH-001 | Domain imports database | src/domain/user.go:15 |
| ARCH-003 | No repository interface | src/domain/ |
| ARCH-005 | Events in wrong layer | src/infrastructure/events.go |

## REFACTOR-002: Implement proper error handling

**Type:** backend
**Effort:** 3h
**Priority:** High
**Dependencies:** REFACTOR-001

### Description
Standardize error handling across the codebase following Go idioms
and project standards.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AC-1: All errors wrapped with context using fmt.Errorf
- [ ] AC-2: No panic() outside of main.go
- [ ] AC-3: Custom error types for domain errors
- [ ] AC-4: Error handling tests added

### Technical Notes
- Use errors.Is/As for error checking
- See PROJECT_RULES.md → Error Handling section

### Issues Addressed
| ID | Description | Location |
|----|-------------|----------|
| CODE-002 | Unwrapped errors | 15 locations |
| CODE-007 | panic in business logic | src/service/order.go:78 |
| CODE-012 | No domain error types | src/domain/ |

## Step 7: User Approval

Present the generated plan and ask for approval using AskUserQuestion tool:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  questions:
    - question: "Review the refactoring plan. How do you want to proceed?"
      header: "Approval"
      multiSelect: false
      options:
        - label: "Approve all"
          description: "Save tasks.md, proceed to dev-cycle execution"
        - label: "Approve with changes"
          description: "Let user edit tasks.md first, then proceed"
        - label: "Critical only"
          description: "Filter to only Critical/High priority tasks"
        - label: "Cancel"
          description: "Abort execution, keep analysis report only"
```

## Step 8: Save Artifacts

Save analysis report and tasks to project:

```text
docs/refactor/{timestamp}/
├── analysis-report.md    # Full analysis with all findings
├── tasks.md              # Approved refactoring tasks
└── project-rules-used.md # Copy of PROJECT_RULES.md at time of analysis
```

**Note:** Ring standards are not saved as they are loaded dynamically by agents via WebFetch. Only the project-specific rules are preserved for reference.

## Step 9: Handoff to dev-cycle

If approved, the workflow continues:

```bash
# Automatic handoff
/ring-dev-team:dev-cycle docs/refactor/{timestamp}/tasks.md
```

This executes each refactoring task through the standard 6-gate process:
- Gate 0: Implementation (TDD)
- Gate 1: DevOps Setup
- Gate 2: SRE (Observability)
- Gate 3: Testing
- Gate 4: Review (3 parallel reviewers)
- Gate 5: Validation (user approval)

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema:
  format: "markdown"
  artifacts:
    - name: "analysis-report.md"
      location: "docs/refactor/{timestamp}/"
      required: true
    - name: "tasks.md"
      location: "docs/refactor/{timestamp}/"
      required: true
  required_sections:
    - name: "Summary"
      pattern: "^## Summary"
      required: true
    - name: "Critical Issues"
      pattern: "^## Critical Issues"
      required: true
    - name: "Tasks Generated"
      pattern: "^## REFACTOR-"
      required: true
```

## Example Usage

```bash
# Full project analysis
/ring-dev-team:dev-refactor

# Analyze specific directory
/ring-dev-team:dev-refactor src/domain

# Analyze with custom standards
/ring-dev-team:dev-refactor --standards path/to/PROJECT_RULES.md

# Analysis only (no execution)
/ring-dev-team:dev-refactor --analyze-only
```

## Related Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `ring-dev-team:dev-cycle` | Executes refactoring tasks through 6 gates (after approval) |

## Key Principles

1. **Same workflow**: Refactoring uses the same dev-cycle as new features
2. **Separation of concerns**: dev-refactor reads PROJECT_RULES.md locally; agents load Ring standards via WebFetch
3. **Standards-driven**: Analysis combines project-specific rules (PROJECT_RULES.md) + Ring standards (loaded by agents)
4. **Traceable**: Every task links back to specific issues found
5. **Incremental**: Can approve subset of tasks (critical only, etc.)
6. **Reversible**: Original analysis preserved for reference
