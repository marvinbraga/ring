# Writing Code - Developer Agent Selection

## Purpose

This skill helps you identify and dispatch the most appropriate developer agent from the ring-developers plugin based on the task requirements.

## Available Developer Agents

| Agent | Specialization | Best For |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| `ring-developers:backend-engineer-golang` | Go, APIs, microservices, databases, message queues | Backend services, REST/gRPC APIs, database design, multi-tenancy |
| `ring-developers:frontend-engineer` | React, Next.js, TypeScript, state management | UI components, dashboards, forms, client-side logic |
| `ring-developers:devops-engineer` | CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, IaC | Pipelines, containerization, infrastructure, deployment |
| `ring-developers:qa-analyst` | Test strategy, E2E, performance testing | Test plans, automation frameworks, quality gates |
| `ring-developers:sre` | Monitoring, observability, reliability | Alerting, SLOs, incident response, performance |

## Decision Matrix

### By Technology Stack

```
Go/Golang code?
├── Yes → backend-engineer-golang
└── No
    ├── React/Next.js/TypeScript frontend?
    │   └── Yes → frontend-engineer
    ├── Infrastructure/CI-CD/Docker?
    │   └── Yes → devops-engineer
    ├── Testing/QA/Automation?
    │   └── Yes → qa-analyst
    └── Monitoring/Reliability/Performance?
        └── Yes → sre
```

### By Task Type

| Task | Primary Agent | Supporting Agent |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| Build REST API | backend-engineer-golang | qa-analyst (tests) |
| Create UI component | frontend-engineer | qa-analyst (E2E) |
| Set up CI/CD | devops-engineer | sre (monitoring) |
| Write test suite | qa-analyst | - |
| Add monitoring | sre | devops-engineer (infra) |
| Database schema | backend-engineer-golang | - |
| Deploy to K8s | devops-engineer | sre (observability) |
| Performance optimization | sre | backend-engineer-golang |

## Agent Dispatch Pattern

### Single Agent Task

```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "ring-developers:backend-engineer-golang"
  prompt: "Design and implement a REST API for user authentication with JWT tokens"
```

### Multi-Agent Workflow

For complex features requiring multiple specialists:

```
Step 1: Backend API
  Task tool → ring-developers:backend-engineer-golang
  "Implement the user service with CRUD operations"

Step 2: Frontend Integration
  Task tool → ring-developers:frontend-engineer
  "Create React components to consume the user API"

Step 3: Testing
  Task tool → ring-developers:qa-analyst
  "Write E2E tests for the user registration flow"

Step 4: Deployment
  Task tool → ring-developers:devops-engineer
  "Create Kubernetes manifests and CI/CD pipeline"

Step 5: Observability
  Task tool → ring-developers:sre
  "Add monitoring, alerting, and SLO definitions"
```

## When NOT to Use Developer Agents

- **Code review** → Use `ring-default:code-reviewer` (parallel with business-logic and security)
- **Planning/Design** → Use `ring-default:brainstorming` or `ring-default:write-plan`
- **Debugging** → Use `ring-default:systematic-debugging` skill
- **Architecture exploration** → Use `ring-default:codebase-explorer`

## Integration with Ring Workflows

### With TDD (test-driven-development)

```
1. Use qa-analyst to design test cases
2. Use appropriate developer agent to implement
3. Use qa-analyst to verify test coverage
```

### With Code Review (requesting-code-review)

```
1. Use developer agent to implement
2. Use ring-default reviewers (parallel) to review
3. Use developer agent to address findings
```

### With Pre-Dev Planning

```
1. Use team-product skills for planning (PRD, TRD)
2. Use ring-default:write-plan for implementation plan
3. Use this skill to identify developer agents for each task
4. Dispatch agents per task with code review between
```

## Remember

1. **Match agent to task** - Don't use backend agent for frontend work
2. **Combine agents for full-stack** - Complex features need multiple specialists
3. **Always review** - Use code reviewers after implementation
4. **Follow skill workflows** - TDD, systematic debugging, verification
5. **Document decisions** - Agents can explain their choices
