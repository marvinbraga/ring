# Anti-Rationalization Patterns for PMM

Canonical source for anti-rationalization patterns used by all pmm-team agents and skills.

AI models naturally attempt to be "helpful" by making autonomous decisions. This is DANGEROUS in structured marketing workflows. These tables use aggressive language intentionally to override the AI's instinct to be accommodating.

## Universal Anti-Rationalizations

These rationalizations are ALWAYS wrong, regardless of context:

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "This is just a draft, standards don't apply" | Drafts become final deliverables. Standards apply to ALL work. | **Apply full standards. No draft exemption.** |
| "The market is moving fast, skip research" | Fast markets require MORE research, not less. Assumptions kill GTM. | **Complete full research phase.** |
| "Competitor info is outdated anyway" | Outdated info + analysis > no info. Acknowledge limitations, don't skip. | **Document assumptions and proceed.** |
| "User knows their market better" | User knowledge + structured analysis > either alone. | **Follow process AND incorporate user insights.** |
| "Similar product worked without this step" | Past non-compliance doesn't justify future non-compliance. | **Follow complete process every time.** |

## Agent-Specific Anti-Rationalizations

### Market Research

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Market size is obvious" | Obvious assumptions cause positioning failures. Verify with data. | **Quantify with sources.** |
| "Just check competitors quickly" | Quick checks miss patterns. Systematic analysis required. | **Complete full competitive analysis.** |
| "User already did market research" | User research + your analysis = complete picture. | **Augment, don't replace.** |

### Positioning & Messaging

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Differentiation is clear" | Clear to you ≠ clear to market. Test and validate. | **Document differentiation with evidence.** |
| "Messaging will evolve anyway" | Evolution requires baseline. Create complete foundation. | **Create full messaging framework.** |
| "Audience is everyone" | Everyone = no one. Specificity drives impact. | **Define specific ICP segments.** |

### GTM Planning

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Launch timeline is aggressive, skip steps" | Skipped steps cause launch failures. Better to delay than fail. | **Complete all gates before launch.** |
| "Pricing can be adjusted later" | Wrong pricing at launch damages brand and revenue. | **Validate pricing before launch.** |
| "Channels are straightforward" | Channel assumptions cause resource waste. Validate systematically. | **Analyze all channel options.** |

## Skill-Specific Anti-Rationalizations

### Gate Execution

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Previous gate passed, this one will too" | Each gate is independent. No assumptions. | **Execute full gate requirements.** |
| "Small market, skip full process" | Size doesn't determine requirements. | **Follow complete process.** |
| "Already tested with focus group" | Focus group ≠ gate compliance. | **Execute systematic verification.** |
