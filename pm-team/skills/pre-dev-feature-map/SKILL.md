# Feature Map Creation - Understanding the Feature Landscape

## Foundational Principle

**Feature relationships and boundaries must be mapped before architectural decisions.**

Jumping from PRD to TRD without mapping creates:
- Architectures that don't match feature interaction patterns
- Missing integration points discovered late
- Poor module boundaries that cross feature concerns
- Difficulty prioritizing work without understanding dependencies

**The Feature Map answers**: How do features relate, group, and interact at a business level?
**The Feature Map never answers**: How we'll technically implement those features (that's TRD).

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- PRD has passed Gate 1 validation
- About to start technical architecture (TRD)
- Need to understand feature scope and relationships
- Multiple features have complex interactions
- Unclear how to group or prioritize features

## Mandatory Workflow

### Phase 1: Feature Analysis (Inputs Required)
1. **Approved PRD** (Gate 1 passed) - business requirements locked
2. **Extract all features** from PRD
3. **Identify user journeys** across features
4. **Map feature interactions** and dependencies

### Phase 2: Feature Mapping
1. **Categorize features** (Core/Supporting/Enhancement/Integration)
2. **Group into domains** (logical business groupings)
3. **Map user journeys** (how users flow through features)
4. **Identify integration points** (where features interact)
5. **Define boundaries** (what each feature owns)
6. **Visualize relationships** (diagrams or structured text)
7. **Prioritize by value** (core vs. nice-to-have)

### Phase 3: Gate 2 Validation
**MANDATORY CHECKPOINT** - Must pass before proceeding to TRD:
- [ ] All PRD features are mapped
- [ ] Feature categories are clearly defined
- [ ] Domain groupings are logical and cohesive
- [ ] User journeys are complete (start to finish)
- [ ] Integration points are identified
- [ ] Feature boundaries are clear (no overlap)
- [ ] Priority levels support phased delivery
- [ ] No technical implementation details included

## Explicit Rules

### ✅ DO Include in Feature Map
- Feature list (extracted from PRD)
- Feature categories (Core/Supporting/Enhancement/Integration)
- Domain groupings (logical business areas)
- User journey maps (how users move through features)
- Feature interactions (which features depend on/trigger others)
- Integration points (where features exchange data/events)
- Feature boundaries (what each feature owns)
- Priority levels (MVP vs. future phases)
- Scope visualization (what's in/out of each phase)

### ❌ NEVER Include in Feature Map
- Technical architecture or component design
- Technology choices or framework decisions
- Database schemas or API specifications
- Implementation approaches or algorithms
- Infrastructure or deployment concerns
- Code structure or file organization
- Protocol choices or data formats

### Feature Categorization Rules
1. **Core**: Must have for MVP, blocks other features
2. **Supporting**: Enables core features, medium priority
3. **Enhancement**: Improves existing features, nice-to-have
4. **Integration**: Connects to external systems, varies by need

### Domain Grouping Rules
1. Group features by business capability (not technical layer)
2. Each domain should have cohesive, related features
3. Minimize cross-domain dependencies
4. Name domains by business function (User Management, Payment Processing)

## Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Feature relationships are obvious" | Obvious to you ≠ documented for team. Map them. |
| "We can figure out groupings during TRD" | TRD architecture follows feature structure. Define it first. |
| "This feels like extra work" | Skipping this causes rework when architecture mismatches features. |
| "The PRD already has this info" | PRD lists features; map shows relationships. Different views. |
| "I'll just mention the components" | Components are technical (TRD). This is business groupings only. |
| "User journeys are in the PRD" | PRD has stories; map shows cross-feature flows. Different levels. |
| "Integration points are technical" | Points WHERE features interact = business. HOW = technical (TRD). |
| "Priorities can be set later" | Priority affects architecture decisions. Set them before TRD. |
| "Boundaries will be clear in code" | Code structure follows feature boundaries. Define them first. |
| "This is just a simple feature" | Even simple features have interactions. Map them. |

## Red Flags - STOP

If you catch yourself writing any of these in a Feature Map, **STOP**:

- Technology names (APIs, databases, frameworks)
- Component names (AuthService, PaymentProcessor)
- Technical terms (microservices, endpoints, schemas)
- Implementation details (how data flows technically)
- Architecture diagrams (system components)
- Code organization (packages, modules, files)
- Protocol specifications (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)

**When you catch yourself**: Remove the technical detail. Focus on WHAT features do and HOW they relate at a business level.

## Gate 2 Validation Checklist

Before proceeding to TRD, verify:

**Feature Completeness**:
- [ ] All PRD features are included in map
- [ ] Each feature has clear description and purpose
- [ ] Feature categories are assigned (Core/Supporting/Enhancement/Integration)
- [ ] No features are missing or overlooked

**Grouping Clarity**:
- [ ] Domains are logically cohesive (related business capabilities)
- [ ] Domain boundaries are clear (no overlapping responsibilities)
- [ ] Cross-domain dependencies are minimized
- [ ] Domain names reflect business function (not technical layer)

**Journey Mapping**:
- [ ] Primary user journeys are documented (start to finish)
- [ ] Journeys show which features users touch
- [ ] Happy path and error scenarios covered
- [ ] Handoff points between features identified

**Integration Points**:
- [ ] All feature interactions are identified
- [ ] Data/event exchange points are marked
- [ ] Directional dependencies are clear (A depends on B)
- [ ] Circular dependencies are flagged and resolved

**Priority & Phasing**:
- [ ] MVP features clearly identified
- [ ] Priority rationale is documented
- [ ] Phasing supports incremental value delivery

**Gate Result**:
- ✅ **PASS**: All checkboxes checked → Proceed to TRD
- ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**: Clarify ambiguous boundaries → Re-validate
- ❌ **FAIL**: Features poorly grouped or missing → Rework

## Output Location

**Always output to**: `docs/pre-development/feature-map/feature-map-[feature-name].md`

## After Feature Map Approval

1. ✅ Lock the Feature Map - feature scope and relationships are now reference
2. 🎯 Use Feature Map as input for TRD (next phase)
3. 🚫 Never add technical architecture to Feature Map retroactively
4. 📋 Keep business features separate from technical components

## Quality Self-Check

Before declaring Feature Map complete, verify:
- [ ] All PRD features are included and categorized
- [ ] Domain groupings are cohesive and logical
- [ ] User journeys show cross-feature flows
- [ ] Integration points are identified (WHAT interacts, not HOW)
- [ ] Feature boundaries are clear (no overlap)
- [ ] Priority levels support phased delivery
- [ ] Dependencies don't create circular blocks
- [ ] Zero technical implementation details present
- [ ] Gate 2 validation checklist 100% complete

## The Bottom Line

**If you wrote a Feature Map with technical architecture details, remove them.**

The Feature Map is business-level feature relationships only. Period. No components. No APIs. No databases.

Technical architecture goes in TRD. That's the next phase. Wait for it.

Violating this separation means:
- You're constraining architecture before understanding feature interactions
- Feature groupings become coupled to technical layers
- You can't objectively design architecture that matches business needs
- Boundaries become technical instead of business-driven

**Map the features. Understand relationships. Then architect in TRD.**
