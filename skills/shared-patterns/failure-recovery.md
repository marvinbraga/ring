# Universal Failure Recovery Pattern

Add this section to any skill with potential failure points:

## When Things Go Wrong

**If you get stuck:**

1. **Attempt failed?**
   - Document exactly what happened
   - Include error messages verbatim
   - Note what you tried

2. **Can't proceed?**
   - State blocker explicitly: "Blocked by: [specific issue]"
   - Don't guess or work around
   - Ask for help

3. **Confused?**
   - Say "I don't understand [specific thing]"
   - Don't pretend to understand
   - Research or ask for clarification

4. **Multiple failures?**
   - After 3 attempts: STOP
   - Document all attempts
   - Reassess approach with human partner

**Never:** Pretend to succeed when stuck
**Never:** Continue after 3 failures
**Never:** Hide confusion or errors
**Always:** Be explicit about blockage
