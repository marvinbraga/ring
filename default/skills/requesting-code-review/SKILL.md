# Code Review (Gate 4)

## Overview

Dispatch all five reviewer subagents in **parallel** for fast, comprehensive feedback:

1. **code-reviewer** - Architecture, design patterns, code quality
2. **business-logic-reviewer** - Domain correctness, business rules, edge cases
3. **security-reviewer** - Vulnerabilities, authentication, OWASP risks
4. **test-reviewer** - Test quality, coverage, edge cases, anti-patterns
5. **nil-safety-reviewer** - Nil/null pointer safety for Go and TypeScript

**Core principle:** All 5 reviewers run simultaneously in a single message with 5 Task tool calls.

## CRITICAL: Role Clarification

**This skill ORCHESTRATES. Reviewer Agents REVIEW.**

| Who | Responsibility |
|-----|----------------|
| **This Skill** | Dispatch reviewers, aggregate findings, track iterations |
| **Reviewer Agents** | Analyze code, report issues with severity |
| **Implementation Agent** | Fix issues found by reviewers |

---

## Step 1: Gather Context (Auto-Detect if Not Provided)

```text
This skill supports TWO modes:
1. WITH INPUTS: Called by any skill/user that provides structured inputs (unit_id, base_sha, etc.)
2. STANDALONE: Called directly without inputs - auto-detects everything from git

FOR EACH INPUT, check if provided OR auto-detect:

1. unit_id:
   IF provided → use it
   ELSE → generate: "review-" + timestamp (e.g., "review-20241222-143052")

2. base_sha:
   IF provided → use it
   ELSE → Execute: git merge-base HEAD main
   IF git fails → Execute: git rev-parse HEAD~10 (fallback to last 10 commits)

3. head_sha:
   IF provided → use it
   ELSE → Execute: git rev-parse HEAD

4. implementation_files:
   IF provided → use it
   ELSE → Execute: git diff --name-only [base_sha] [head_sha]

5. implementation_summary:
   IF provided → use it
   ELSE → Execute: git log --oneline [base_sha]..[head_sha]
   Format as: "Changes: [list of commit messages]"

6. requirements:
   IF provided → use it
   ELSE → Set to: "Infer requirements from code changes and commit messages"
   (Reviewers will analyze code to understand intent)

AFTER AUTO-DETECTION, display context:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📋 CODE REVIEW CONTEXT                                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Unit ID: [unit_id]                                              │
│ Base SHA: [base_sha]                                            │
│ Head SHA: [head_sha]                                            │
│ Files Changed: [count] files                                    │
│ Commits: [count] commits                                        │
│                                                                 │
│ Dispatching 5 reviewers in parallel...                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Step 2: Initialize Review State

```text
review_state = {
  unit_id: [from input],
  base_sha: [from input],
  head_sha: [from input],
  reviewers: {
    code_reviewer: {verdict: null, issues: []},
    business_logic_reviewer: {verdict: null, issues: []},
    security_reviewer: {verdict: null, issues: []},
    test_reviewer: {verdict: null, issues: []},
    nil_safety_reviewer: {verdict: null, issues: []}
  },
  aggregated_issues: {
    critical: [],
    high: [],
    medium: [],
    low: [],
    cosmetic: []
  },
  iterations: 0,
  max_iterations: 3
}
```

## Step 3: Dispatch All 5 Reviewers in Parallel

**⛔ CRITICAL: All 5 reviewers MUST be dispatched in a SINGLE message with 5 Task calls.**

```yaml

    **Languages:** [Go|TypeScript|both - detect from files]

    ## What Was Implemented
    [implementation_summary]

    ## Requirements
    [requirements]

    ## Your Focus
    - Nil/null pointer risks in changed code
    - Missing nil guards before dereference
    - Map access without ok check (Go)
    - Type assertions without ok check (Go)
    - Optional chaining misuse (TypeScript)

    | Severity | Description | File:Line | Recommendation |
    |----------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
    | [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | [issue] | [location] | [fix] |

    ### Nil Risk Trace
    [For each risk: Source → Propagation → Dereference point]
```

## Step 4: Wait for All Reviewers and Parse Output

```text
Wait for all 5 Task calls to complete.

For each reviewer:
1. Extract VERDICT (PASS/FAIL)
2. Extract Issues Found table
3. Categorize issues by severity

review_state.reviewers.code_reviewer = {
  verdict: [PASS/FAIL],
  issues: [parsed issues]
}
// ... same for other reviewers

Aggregate all issues by severity:
review_state.aggregated_issues.critical = [all critical from all reviewers]
review_state.aggregated_issues.high = [all high from all reviewers]
// ... etc
```

## Step 5: Handle Results by Severity

```text
Count blocking issues:
blocking_count = critical.length + high.length + medium.length

IF blocking_count == 0:
  → All reviewers PASS
  → Proceed to Step 8 (Success)

IF blocking_count > 0:
  → review_state.iterations += 1
  → IF iterations >= max_iterations: Go to Step 9 (Escalate)
  → Go to Step 6 (Dispatch Fixes)
```

## Step 6: Dispatch Fixes to Implementation Agent

**⛔ CRITICAL: You are an ORCHESTRATOR. You CANNOT edit source files directly.**
**You MUST dispatch the implementation agent to fix ALL review issues.**

### Orchestrator Boundaries (HARD GATE)

**See [dev-team/skills/shared-patterns/standards-boundary-enforcement.md](../../dev-team/skills/shared-patterns/standards-boundary-enforcement.md) for core enforcement rules.**

**Key prohibition:** Edit/Write/Create on source files is FORBIDDEN. Always dispatch agent.

**If you catch yourself about to use Edit/Write/Create on source files → STOP. Dispatch agent.**

### Dispatch Implementation Agent

```yaml
Task:
  subagent_type: "[implementation_agent from Gate 0]"
  model: "opus"
  description: "Fix review issues for [unit_id]"
  prompt: |
    ⛔ FIX REQUIRED - Code Review Issues Found

    ## Context
    - **Unit ID:** [unit_id]
    - **Iteration:** [iterations] of [max_iterations]

    ## Critical Issues (MUST FIX)
    [list critical issues with file:line and recommendation]

    ## High Issues (MUST FIX)
    [list high issues]

    ## Medium Issues (MUST FIX)
    [list medium issues]

    ## Requirements
    1. Fix ALL Critical, High, and Medium issues
    2. Run tests to verify fixes
    3. Commit fixes with descriptive message
    4. Return list of fixed issues with evidence

    ## For Low/Cosmetic Issues
    Add TODO/FIXME comments:
    - Low: `// TODO(review): [Issue] - [reviewer] on [date]`
    - Cosmetic: `// FIXME(nitpick): [Issue] - [reviewer] on [date]`
```

### Anti-Rationalization for Direct Editing

**See [shared-patterns/orchestrator-direct-editing-anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/orchestrator-direct-editing-anti-rationalization.md) for complete anti-rationalization table.**

*Applies to: Step 6 (Fix dispatch after Ring reviewers) & Step 7.5.3 (Fix dispatch after CodeRabbit)*

## Step 7: Re-Run All Reviewers After Fixes

```text
After fixes committed:
1. Get new HEAD_SHA
2. Go back to Step 3 (dispatch all 5 reviewers again)

⛔ CRITICAL: Always re-run ALL 5 reviewers after fixes.
Do NOT cherry-pick reviewers.
```

## Step 7.5: CodeRabbit CLI Validation (Per-Subtask/Task)

**⛔ NEW APPROACH: CodeRabbit validates EACH subtask/task as it completes, accumulating findings to a file.**

### CodeRabbit Integration Overview

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CODERABBIT PER-UNIT VALIDATION FLOW                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│ DURING REVIEW (after each subtask/task Ring reviewers pass):   │
│   1. Run CodeRabbit for that unit's files                      │
│   2. Append findings to .coderabbit-findings.md                │
│   3. Continue to next unit                                     │
│                                                                 │
│ BEFORE COMMIT (Step 8):                                        │
│   1. Display accumulated .coderabbit-findings.md               │
│   2. User decides: fix issues OR acknowledge and proceed       │
│                                                                 │
│ BENEFITS:                                                      │
│   • Catches issues close to when code was written              │
│   • Smaller scope = faster reviews (7-30 min per unit)         │
│   • Issues isolated to specific units, easier to fix           │
│   • Accumulated file provides audit trail                      │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Rate Limits (Official - per developer per repository per hour)

| Limit Type | Value | Notes |
|------------|-------|-------|
| Files reviewed | 200 files/hour | Per review |
| Reviews | 3 back-to-back, then 4/hour | **7 reviews possible in first hour** |
| Conversations | 25 back-to-back, then 50/hour | For follow-up questions |

**⏱️ TIMING:** Each CodeRabbit review takes **7-30+ minutes** depending on scope.
Run in background and check periodically for completion.

### Common Commands Reference

<a id="coderabbit-install-check"></a>
**CodeRabbit Installation Check:**
```bash
which coderabbit || which cr
```
> Used in Step 7.5.1 and after installation to verify CLI availability.

### ⚠️ PREREQUISITES & ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS

**Before attempting Step 7.5, verify your environment supports the required operations:**

| Requirement | Local Dev | CI/CD | Containerized | Remote/SSH |
|-------------|-----------|-------|---------------|------------|
| `curl \| sh` install | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ May require elevated permissions | ❌ Often blocked | ⚠️ Depends on config |
| Browser auth (`coderabbit auth login`) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No browser | ❌ No browser | ❌ No browser |
| Write to `$HOME/.coderabbit/` | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Ephemeral | ⚠️ Ephemeral | ✅ Usually |
| Internet access to `cli.coderabbit.ai` | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Check firewall | ⚠️ Check firewall | ⚠️ Check firewall |

**⛔ HARD STOP CONDITIONS - Skip Step 7.5 if ANY apply:**
- Running in containerized environment without persistent storage
- CI/CD pipeline without pre-installed CodeRabbit CLI
- Non-interactive environment (no TTY for browser auth)
- Network restrictions blocking `cli.coderabbit.ai`
- Read-only filesystem

### Environment-Specific Guidance

#### Local Development (RECOMMENDED)
Standard flow works: `curl | sh` install + browser authentication.

#### CI/CD Pipelines
**Option A: Pre-install in CI image**
```dockerfile
# Add to your CI Dockerfile
RUN curl -fsSL https://cli.coderabbit.ai/install.sh | sh
```

**Option B: Use API token authentication (headless)**
```bash
# Set token via environment variable (add to CI secrets)
export CODERABBIT_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
coderabbit auth login --token "$CODERABBIT_API_TOKEN"
```

**Option C: Skip CodeRabbit in CI, run locally**
```bash
# In CI config, set env var to auto-skip
export SKIP_CODERABBIT_REVIEW=true
```

#### Containerized/Docker Environments
```bash
# Option 1: Mount credentials from host
docker run -v ~/.coderabbit:/root/.coderabbit ...

# Option 2: Pass token as env var
docker run -e CODERABBIT_API_TOKEN="..." ...

# Option 3: Pre-bake into image (not recommended for tokens)
```

#### Non-Interactive/Headless Authentication
```bash
# Generate API token at: https://app.coderabbit.ai/settings/api-tokens
# Then authenticate without browser:
coderabbit auth login --token "cr_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

│ CodeRabbit provides additional AI-powered code review that      │
│ catches race conditions, memory leaks, security vulnerabilities,│
│ and edge cases that may complement Ring reviewers.              │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**⛔ HARD GATE: CodeRabbit Execution Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

| Scenario | Rule | Action |
|----------|------|--------|
| **Installed & authenticated** | **MANDATORY** - CANNOT skip | Run CodeRabbit review, no prompt |
| **Not installed** | **MUST ask** user about installation | Present installation option |
| **User declines installation** | Optional - can proceed | Skip and continue to Step 8 |

**Why this distinction:**
- If CodeRabbit IS installed → User has committed to using it → MUST run
- If CodeRabbit is NOT installed → User choice to add it → MUST ask, but can decline

```text
FLOW:
1. Run CodeRabbit Installation Check
2. IF installed AND authenticated → Run CodeRabbit (MANDATORY, NO prompt, CANNOT skip)
3. IF installed BUT NOT authenticated → Guide authentication (REQUIRED before proceeding)
4. IF NOT installed → MUST ask user about installation (REQUIRED prompt)
5. IF user declines installation → Skip CodeRabbit, proceed to Step 8 (only valid skip path)
```

### Anti-Rationalization for CodeRabbit Execution

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "CodeRabbit is optional, I'll skip it" | If installed, it's MANDATORY. Optional only means installation is optional. | **Run CodeRabbit if installed** |
| "Ring reviewers passed, that's enough" | Different tools catch different issues. CodeRabbit complements Ring. | **Run CodeRabbit if installed** |
| "User didn't ask for CodeRabbit" | User installed it. Installation = consent to mandatory execution. | **Run CodeRabbit if installed** |
| "Takes too long, skip this time" | Time is irrelevant. Installed = mandatory. | **Run CodeRabbit if installed** |
| "I'll just proceed without asking about install" | MUST ask every user if they want to install. No silent skips. | **Ask user about installation** |

#### Step 7.5.1: Check CodeRabbit Installation

Run the [CodeRabbit Installation Check](#coderabbit-install-check) command.

**IF INSTALLED AND AUTHENTICATED → MANDATORY EXECUTION (CANNOT SKIP):**

```
→ Proceed directly to Step 7.5.2 (Run CodeRabbit Review) - **NO user prompt, NO skip option**

**IF NOT INSTALLED → MUST ASK USER (REQUIRED PROMPT):**

**⛔ You MUST present this prompt to the user. Silent skips are FORBIDDEN.**

#### Step 7.5.2: Run CodeRabbit Review

**⛔ GRANULAR VALIDATION: CodeRabbit MUST validate at the most granular level available.**

```text
DETERMINE VALIDATION SCOPE:
1. Check if current work has subtasks (from gate0_handoff or implementation context)
2. IF subtasks exist → Validate EACH SUBTASK separately
3. IF no subtasks → Validate the TASK as a whole

WHY GRANULAR VALIDATION:
- Subtask-level validation catches issues early
- Easier to pinpoint which subtask introduced problems
- Prevents "works for task A, breaks task B" scenarios
- Enables incremental fixes without re-running entire review
```

**Step 7.5.2a: Determine Validation Scope**

```text
validation_scope = {
  mode: null,  // "subtask" or "task"
  units: [],   // list of {id, files, commits} to validate
  current_index: 0
}

IF gate0_handoff.subtasks exists AND gate0_handoff.subtasks.length > 0:
  → validation_scope.mode = "subtask"
  → FOR EACH subtask in gate0_handoff.subtasks:
      → Get files changed by this subtask (from commits or file mapping)
      → Add to validation_scope.units: {
          id: subtask.id,
          name: subtask.name,
          files: [files touched by this subtask],
          base_sha: [sha before subtask],
          head_sha: [sha after subtask]

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ⛔ MANDATORY: APPEND FINDINGS TO .coderabbit-findings.md
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  
  After EACH unit validation, append results to findings file:
  
  IF .coderabbit-findings.md does NOT exist:
    → Create file with header (see "Findings File Format" below)
  
  APPEND to .coderabbit-findings.md:
  ```
  ## Unit: [unit.id] - [unit.name]
  **Validated:** [timestamp]
  **Status:** [PASS | ISSUES_FOUND]
  **Files:** [unit.files.join(", ")]
  
  ### Issues Found
  | # | Severity | Description | File:Line | Recommendation |
  |---|----------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
  | 1 | [severity] | [description] | [file:line] | [recommendation] |

**File Location:** Project root (`.coderabbit-findings.md`)

**Lifecycle:**
1. Created when first CodeRabbit validation runs
2. Appended after each unit validation
3. Displayed before commit (Step 8)
4. User decides: fix issues or acknowledge and proceed
5. After commit, file can be deleted or kept for audit

#### Step 7.5.3: Handle CodeRabbit Findings

**⛔ CRITICAL: You are an ORCHESTRATOR. You CANNOT edit source files directly.**
**You MUST dispatch the implementation agent to fix issues.**

**⛔ GRANULAR FIX DISPATCH: Fixes MUST be dispatched per-unit (subtask or task).**

    ─────────────────────────────────────────
    1. Get new HEAD_SHA after CodeRabbit fixes
    2. Dispatch all 5 reviewers in parallel (per Step 3):
       - code-reviewer
       - business-logic-reviewer
       - security-reviewer
       - test-reviewer
       - nil-safety-reviewer
    3. Wait for all 5 to complete
    
    Step 7.5.3b: Handle Ring Reviewer Results
    ─────────────────────────────────────────
    IF all 5 Ring reviewers PASS:
      → Proceed to Step 8 (Success Output)
    
    IF any Ring reviewer finds CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM issues:
      → Increment ring_revalidation_iterations counter
      → IF ring_revalidation_iterations >= 2:
          → ESCALATE: "Max iterations reached after CodeRabbit fixes"
          → Go to Step 9 (Escalate)
      → DISPATCH implementation agent to fix Ring reviewer issues
      → After fixes committed:
          → Re-run CodeRabbit: `coderabbit --prompt-only`
          → IF CodeRabbit passes:
              → Re-run all 5 Ring reviewers (loop back to Step 7.5.3a)
          → IF CodeRabbit finds issues:
              → Fix CodeRabbit issues first, then re-run Ring reviewers
    
    State tracking for CodeRabbit fix cycle:
    ```
    coderabbit_fix_state = {
      coderabbit_iterations: 0,      // max 2 for CodeRabbit-only fixes
      ring_revalidation_iterations: 0,  // max 2 for Ring reviewer re-runs
      total_max_iterations: 4        // absolute cap: 2 CR + 2 Ring
    }
    ```

IF CodeRabbit found only MEDIUM/LOW issues:
  → Display summary
  → ⛔ DO NOT edit files directly to add TODOs
  → DISPATCH implementation agent to add TODO comments:
  
  Task:
    subagent_type: "[same agent used in Gate 0]"
    description: "Add TODO comments for CodeRabbit findings"
    prompt: |
      Add TODO comments for these CodeRabbit findings:
      [list MEDIUM/LOW issues with file:line]
      
      Format: // TODO(coderabbit): [issue description]
  
  → After TODO comments added (code changed):
      → Re-run all 5 Ring reviewers (per Step 7.5.3a above)
      → IF Ring reviewers PASS: Proceed to Step 8
      → IF Ring reviewers find issues: Fix and re-run (max 2 iterations)

IF CodeRabbit found no issues:
  → Display: "✅ CodeRabbit review passed - no additional issues found"
  → No code changes made by CodeRabbit flow
  → Proceed directly to Step 8 (no Ring re-run needed)
```

#### Step 7.5.4: CodeRabbit Results Summary

```markdown
## CodeRabbit External Review
**Status:** [PASS|ISSUES_FOUND|SKIPPED]
**Validation Mode:** [SUBTASK-LEVEL|TASK-LEVEL]
**Units Validated:** [N]
**Total Issues Found:** [N]
**Issues Resolved:** [N]/[N]

### Per-Unit Validation Results
| Unit ID | Unit Name | Status | Critical | High | Medium | Low |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|------|--------|-----|
| [subtask-1] | [name] | ✅ PASS | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| [subtask-2] | [name] | ✅ FIXED | 1→0 | 2→0 | 0 | 0 |
| [task-id] | [name] | ✅ PASS | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

### Issues Found - Detailed Description (ALWAYS shown when issues exist)

#### Unit: [subtask-2]
| # | Severity | Description | File:Line | Code Context | Why It Matters | Recommendation |
|---|----------|-------------|-----------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | CRITICAL | Race condition | handler.go:45 | `h.counter++` not thread-safe | Corrupts shared state | Use sync.Mutex |
| 2 | HIGH | Unchecked error | repo.go:123 | `result, _ := r.db.Query()` | Silent failures | Handle error |
| 3 | HIGH | SQL injection | query.go:89 | `fmt.Sprintf("...%s", input)` | Security breach | Parameterized query |

### Issue-Level Validation (REQUIRED after fixes are applied)

#### Unit: [subtask-2]
| # | Severity | Description | File:Line | Fix Applied | Status | Evidence |
|---|----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | CRITICAL | Race condition in concurrent handler | handler.go:45 | Added mutex lock around shared state | ✅ RESOLVED | race_test.go passes |
| 2 | HIGH | Unchecked error from DB query | repo.go:123 | Added error check with rollback | ✅ RESOLVED | Error path tested |
| 3 | HIGH | SQL injection vulnerability | query.go:89 | Used parameterized query | ✅ RESOLVED | Security test added |

#### Unit: [subtask-3] (if applicable)
| # | Severity | Description | File:Line | Fix Applied | Status | Evidence |
|---|----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | HIGH | Missing input validation | api.go:34 | Added validation middleware | ✅ RESOLVED | Fuzz test passes |

### Overall Summary by Severity
| Severity | Found | Resolved | Remaining | Action |
|----------|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Critical | [N] | [N] | 0 | Fixed |
| High | [N] | [N] | 0 | Fixed |
| Medium | [N] | [N] | 0 | TODO added |
| Low | [N] | - | [N] | TODO added |
```

### CodeRabbit Skip Scenarios (ONLY VALID PATHS)

**⛔ CodeRabbit can ONLY be skipped in these specific scenarios. Any other skip is a VIOLATION.**

| Scenario | Record As | Next Step | Why Valid |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| CLI not installed, user **explicitly** declines install | `SKIPPED (not installed, user declined)` | Step 8 | User was asked and chose not to install |
| Installation failed after attempt, user skips | `SKIPPED (installation failed)` | Step 8 | Technical failure, user informed |
| Authentication failed after attempt, user skips | `SKIPPED (auth failed)` | Step 8 | Technical failure, user informed |
| Environment doesn't support (CI/container) | `SKIPPED (unsupported environment)` | Step 8 | Technical limitation |

**⛔ INVALID SKIP SCENARIOS (FORBIDDEN):**

| Invalid Scenario | Why FORBIDDEN | Required Action |
|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| CLI installed but "skipped for speed" | Installed = MANDATORY | **Run CodeRabbit** |
| CLI installed but "Ring reviewers passed" | Complementary tools, both required | **Run CodeRabbit** |
| CLI not installed, no prompt shown | MUST ask user about installation | **Show installation prompt** |
| Silent skip without user interaction | All skips require explicit user choice | **Ask user** |

**⛔ NON-NEGOTIABLE:** When CodeRabbit CLI IS installed and authenticated, execution is **MANDATORY** - it CANNOT be skipped under any circumstance.

## Pressure Resistance

See [dev-team/skills/shared-patterns/shared-pressure-resistance.md](../../dev-team/skills/shared-patterns/shared-pressure-resistance.md) for universal pressure scenarios.

| User Says | Your Response |
|-----------|---------------|
| "Skip review, code is simple" | "Simple code can have security issues. Dispatching all 5 reviewers." |
| "Just run code-reviewer" | "All 5 reviewers run in parallel. No time saved by skipping." |
| "Fix later, merge now" | "Blocking issues (Critical/High/Medium) MUST be fixed before Gate 5." |

## Anti-Rationalization Table

See [dev-team/skills/shared-patterns/shared-anti-rationalization.md](../../dev-team/skills/shared-patterns/shared-anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations.

### Gate 4-Specific Anti-Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Run reviewers one at a time" | Sequential = slow. Parallel = 5x faster. | **Dispatch all 5 in single message** |
| "Skip security for internal code" | Internal code can have vulnerabilities. | **Include security-reviewer** |
| "Critical issue is false positive" | Prove it with evidence, don't assume. | **Fix or provide evidence** |
| "Low issues don't need TODO" | TODOs ensure issues aren't forgotten. | **Add TODO comments** |
| "4 of 5 reviewers passed" | Gate 4 requires ALL 5. 4/5 = 0/5. | **Re-run ALL 5 reviewers** |
| "MEDIUM is not blocking" | MEDIUM = MUST FIX. Same as CRITICAL/HIGH. | **Fix MEDIUM issues NOW** |
