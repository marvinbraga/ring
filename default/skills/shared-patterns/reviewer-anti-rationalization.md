# Reviewer Anti-Rationalization

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Applies to:** All reviewer agents

## Why This Matters

AI models naturally attempt to be "helpful" by making autonomous decisions. In review context, this is DANGEROUS.

**Rationalization = Failure Mode**

When you generate thoughts like "I can skip this because...", that's rationalization. STOP and complete the full review.

## Core Principle

**Assumption ≠ Verification**

- You don't decide what's relevant—the checklist does
- Every item you're tempted to skip has caught real bugs in the past
- Your job is to VERIFY, not to ASSUME

## Universal Anti-Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Code looks clean/correct" | Appearance ≠ correctness. Clean code can have logic bugs, security issues. | **Review ALL checklist categories** |
| "Author is experienced" | Experience ≠ error-free. Everyone makes mistakes. | **Review ALL checklist categories** |
| "Small change, probably safe" | Size ≠ risk. One line can introduce critical vulnerabilities. | **Review ALL checklist categories** |
| "Tests are passing" | Tests may be incomplete, miss edge cases. Tests ≠ independent review. | **Review ALL checklist categories** |
| "Similar code exists elsewhere" | Existing code ≠ correct code. Technical debt propagates. | **Review ALL checklist categories** |
| "No time for full review" | Incomplete review = wasted review. Better to delay than approve bad code. | **Review ALL checklist categories** |
| "Other reviewers will catch it" | Each reviewer is independent. Cannot assume others catch adjacent issues. | **Review ALL checklist categories** |
| "Plan says it's correct" | Plan ≠ implementation. Verify code actually matches plan. | **Compare implementation vs. plan** |
| "Only checking what seems relevant" | You don't decide relevance. Checklist decides. | **Review ALL checklist categories** |
| "Previous review approved similar" | Each review independent. Standards evolve. | **Review current changes thoroughly** |

## AI-Specific Anti-Rationalization

These rationalizations are common in AI-generated reviews:

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "This package is standard/common" | AI hallucinates package names. "Common" ≠ exists. | **Verify package in registry** |
| "Code follows best practices" | AI applies patterns mechanically. Pattern ≠ appropriate. | **Verify patterns are warranted** |
| "Interface added for testability" | Single-implementation interfaces often AI slop. | **Question if abstraction needed** |
| "Added for future extensibility" | YAGNI. AI adds abstractions for hypothetical futures. | **Remove unless in requirements** |
| "Matches patterns I've seen" | AI uses training data patterns. May not match THIS codebase. | **Compare against actual codebase** |
| "Standard library for this" | AI may have hallucinated the library. | **Verify dependency exists** |

## Domain-Specific Anti-Rationalization

### Code Reviewer
| Rationalization | Required Action |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "Code is refactoring, logic unchanged" | **Verify behavior preservation through tracing** |
| "Modern frameworks handle this" | **Verify security features enabled correctly** |

### Business Logic Reviewer
| Rationalization | Required Action |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "Business rules documented elsewhere" | **Verify implementation matches docs** |
| "Edge cases unlikely" | **Check ALL critical edge cases** |
| "Mental execution can be brief" | **Include detailed analysis regardless** |

### Security Reviewer
| Rationalization | Required Action |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "Behind firewall, can skip checks" | **Review ALL security aspects** |
| "Low probability of exploit" | **Classify by impact, not probability** |
| "Sanitized input elsewhere" | **Verify validation at ALL entry points** |

### Test Reviewer
| Rationalization | Required Action |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "Happy path is covered" | **Verify error paths and edge cases too** |
| "Mocking is appropriate here" | **Verify tests don't test mock behavior** |
| "Integration tests cover this" | **Verify each test type serves its purpose** |

### Nil-Safety Reviewer
| Rationalization | Required Action |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "Nil checked at call site" | **Trace full call chain** |
| "Interface won't be nil" | **Verify interface implementation handling** |
| "Error already checked" | **Verify value not used when error non-nil** |

## Self-Check Protocol

Before completing your review, ask yourself:

1. **Did I complete ALL checklist items?** (not just relevant-seeming ones)
2. **Did I verify or assume?** (evidence vs. trust)
3. **Did I skip anything because it "seemed fine"?** (appearance vs. verification)
4. **Would I bet my reputation on this review?** (accountability check)

**If you catch yourself rationalizing:** STOP. Go back. Complete the full review.

## Enforcement

This is not optional guidance. This is a **HARD GATE**.

Every rationalization in the tables above represents a real failure mode that has caused missed bugs in production.

**Your role:** VERIFY, not ASSUME.
