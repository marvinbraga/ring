description: Complete 9-gate pre-dev workflow for large features (≥2 days)
argument-hint: "[feature-name]"
---

I'm running the **Full Track** pre-development workflow (9 gates) for your feature.

**This track is for features that have ANY of:**
- ❌ Take ≥2 days to implement
- ❌ Add new external dependencies (APIs, databases, libraries)
- ❌ Create new data models or entities
- ❌ Require multi-service integration
- ❌ Use new architecture patterns
- ❌ Require team collaboration

**If feature is simple (<2 days, existing patterns), use `/ring-pm-team:pre-dev-feature` instead.**

## Document Organization

All artifacts will be saved to: `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/`

**First, let me ask you about your feature:**

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to gather:

**Question 1:** "What is the name of your feature?"
- Header: "Feature Name"
- This will be used for the directory name
- Use kebab-case (e.g., "auth-system", "payment-processing", "file-upload")

After getting the feature name, create the directory structure and run the 9-gate workflow:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>
```

## Gate 0: Research Phase (NEW)

**Skill:** ring-pm-team:pre-dev-research

1. Determine research mode by asking user or inferring from context:
   - **greenfield**: New capability, no existing patterns
   - **modification**: Extending existing functionality
   - **integration**: Connecting external systems

2. Dispatch 3 research agents in PARALLEL:
   - repo-research-analyst (codebase patterns, file:line refs)
   - best-practices-researcher (web search, Context7)
   - framework-docs-researcher (tech stack, versions)

3. Aggregate findings into research document
4. Save to: `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/research.md`
5. Run Gate 0 validation checklist
6. Get human approval before proceeding

**Gate 0 Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Research mode determined and documented
- [ ] All 3 agents dispatched and returned
- [ ] At least one file:line reference (if modification mode)

```
✅ Full Track (9 gates) complete for <feature-name>

Artifacts created:
- docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/research.md (Gate 0) ← NEW
- docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/prd.md (Gate 1)
- docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/feature-map.md (Gate 2)
- docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/trd.md (Gate 3)
- docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/api-design.md (Gate 4)
- docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/data-model.md (Gate 5)
- docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/dependency-map.md (Gate 6)
- docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/tasks.md (Gate 7)
- docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/subtasks.md (Gate 8)

Planning time: 2-4 hours (comprehensive)

Next steps:
1. Review artifacts in docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/
2. Use /ring-default:worktree to create isolated workspace
3. Use /ring-default:write-plan to create implementation plan
4. Execute the plan
```

## Remember

- This is the **Full Track** - comprehensive and thorough
- All 9 gates provide maximum planning depth
- **Gate 0 (Research) runs 3 agents in parallel** for codebase, best practices, and framework docs
- Technology decisions happen at Gate 6 (Dependency Map)
- All documents saved to `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/`
- Get human approval at each gate before proceeding
- Planning investment (2-4 hours) pays off during implementation
