# Competitive Intelligence

Comprehensive competitive analysis including landscape mapping, battlecards, and ongoing tracking.

## Purpose

Competitive intelligence informs strategic decisions:
- Positioning requires understanding competitive alternatives
- Messaging requires competitive differentiation
- Sales requires battlecards for objection handling
- Strategy requires tracking competitor movements

**Competitive intel should be refreshed regularly, not one-time.**

| Conflicting competitive claims | STOP. Verify with multiple sources. |

## Anti-Rationalization Table

See [shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations.

### Gate-Specific Anti-Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "We don't have competitors" | Every product has alternatives, including doing nothing | **Identify all alternatives** |
| "We know our competitors" | Assumptions miss updates and nuance | **Systematic analysis required** |
| "Battlecards are just for sales" | Competitive intel informs all GTM | **Create comprehensive intel** |
| "Competition is irrelevant" | Market context always matters | **Analyze regardless of lead** |

## Pressure Resistance

See [shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md](../shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md) for universal pressure scenarios.

### Gate-Specific Pressures

| Pressure Type | Request | Agent Response |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| "Quick competitive scan" | "Just list competitors" | "Lists without analysis miss insights. Completing full analysis." |
| "Focus on weak competitors" | "Only analyze ones we beat" | "Strong competitors inform strategy. Analyzing all." |
| "Skip the battlecards" | "Sales can figure it out" | "Sales enablement drives wins. Creating battlecards." |
