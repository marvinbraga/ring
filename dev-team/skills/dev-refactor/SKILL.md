# Dev Refactor Skill

This skill analyzes an existing codebase to identify gaps between current implementation and project standards, then generates a structured refactoring plan compatible with the dev-cycle workflow.

---

## ⛔ HARD GATES - READ BEFORE EXECUTING

**This skill has TWO mandatory hard gates. Violation of either gate is a SKILL FAILURE.**

### Gate 1: PROJECT_RULES.md (Prerequisite)

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `docs/PROJECT_RULES.md` exists | Proceed |
| `docs/STANDARDS.md` exists (legacy) | Proceed |
| Neither exists | **STOP** - Cannot analyze without project standards |

### Gate 2: Agent Dispatch (Execution)

**⛔ FORBIDDEN:** Using generic agents (`Explore`, `general-purpose`, `ring-default:codebase-explorer`) for codebase analysis.

**⛔ MANDATORY:** Use ONLY `ring-dev-team:*` specialized agents.

#### Agent Selection by Language

| Manifest Found | Language | REQUIRED Agent |
|----------------|----------|----------------|
| `go.mod` | Go | `ring-dev-team:backend-engineer-golang` |
| `package.json` + react/next/vue | Frontend TS | `ring-dev-team:frontend-bff-engineer-typescript` |
| `package.json` + express/fastify/nestjs | Backend TS | `ring-dev-team:backend-engineer-typescript` |
| `Dockerfile` only | DevOps | `ring-dev-team:devops-engineer` |
| Multiple manifests | Mixed | Dispatch ALL applicable language agents |

#### 4-Agent Parallel Dispatch (Step 3)

**All 4 agents MUST be dispatched in a SINGLE message (parallel execution):**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SINGLE Task tool message with 4 parallel agent calls:      │
│                                                             │
│  1. ring-dev-team:{language-agent}  → Code/Architecture     │
│  2. ring-dev-team:qa-analyst        → Testing               │
│  3. ring-dev-team:devops-engineer   → DevOps                │
│  4. ring-dev-team:sre               → SRE/Observability     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Violations - STOP IMMEDIATELY

| Violation | Why It's Wrong | Required Action |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Using `Explore` agent | Generic, lacks language-specific standards | Re-dispatch with correct agent |
| Using `general-purpose` agent | No specialized Go/TS knowledge | Re-dispatch with correct agent |
| Using `ring-default:codebase-explorer` | Architecture-only, missing code quality | Re-dispatch with correct agent |
| Dispatching agents sequentially | Wastes time, should be parallel | Re-send as single message |
| Dispatching < 4 agents | Incomplete analysis | Add missing agents |
| Reading >3 files directly | Violates 3-file rule | Use agents instead |

**If you already violated a gate:** STOP current approach. Re-execute with correct agents.

### Pressure Resistance - DO NOT RATIONALIZE

**If you catch yourself thinking ANY of these, STOP immediately:**

#### Agent & Execution Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Explore agent is faster" | Generic agent lacks language-specific standards | Use `ring-dev-team:*` agent |
| "I'll just read the files directly" | Violates 3-file rule, incomplete analysis | Dispatch specialized agents |
| "One agent is enough" | 4 dimensions require 4 specialized agents | Dispatch all 4 in parallel |
| "Sequential dispatch is fine" | Wastes time, skill requires parallel | Single message, 4 agents |
| "PROJECT_RULES.md not needed" | Cannot analyze without project standards | STOP, require file first |

#### Analysis Scope Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Code works fine" | Working ≠ maintainable. Analysis finds hidden debt. | Complete full analysis |
| "Code works, skip analysis" | Working ≠ maintainable. Technical debt hidden. | Complete all 4 dimensions |
| "Too time-consuming" | Cost of analysis < cost of compounding debt | Complete full analysis |
| "No time for full analysis" | Partial analysis = partial picture | All 4 dimensions required |
| "Standards don't fit us" | Document YOUR standards. Analysis still reveals gaps. | Analyze against project rules |
| "Only critical matters" | Today's medium = tomorrow's critical | Document all severities |
| "Only critical issues matter" | Medium issues become critical over time | Document all, prioritize later |
| "Legacy gets a pass" | Legacy sets precedent. Analysis shows what to improve. | Document all gaps |
| "Standards don't apply to legacy" | Legacy needs analysis MOST | Full analysis required |
| "Team has their own way" | Document "their way" as standards. Analyze against it. | Use PROJECT_RULES.md |
| "That's just how we do it here" | Undocumented patterns = inconsistent patterns | Document in PROJECT_RULES.md |

#### ROI & Justification Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "ROI of refactoring is low" | ROI calculation requires analysis. Can't calculate without data. | Complete analysis first |
| "ROI doesn't justify full analysis" | You can't know ROI without the analysis data | Complete analysis, then evaluate |
| "Partial analysis is enough" | Partial analysis = partial picture. Hidden debt in skipped areas. | All 4 dimensions required |
| "Partial analysis is sufficient" | Missing dimensions = missing problems | Complete all dimensions |
| "3 years without bugs = stable" | No bugs ≠ no debt. Time doesn't validate architecture. | Full architecture analysis |
| "3+ years stable = no debt" | Stability ≠ maintainability. Debt compounds silently. | Complete analysis |
| "Analysis is overkill" | Analysis is the MINIMUM. Refactoring without analysis is guessing. | Complete all steps |
| "Code smells ≠ problems" | Code smells ARE problems. They slow development and cause bugs. | Document all findings |
| "Code smells aren't real problems" | Smells indicate deeper issues. They compound over time. | Document all severities |
| "No specific problem motivating" | Technical debt IS the problem. Analysis quantifies it. | Complete analysis |
| "No specific problem to solve" | Unknown problems are still problems. Analysis reveals them. | Full 4-dimension scan |

#### Completion Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Analysis complete, user can decide" | Analysis without action guidance is incomplete. | Generate tasks.md |
| "Analysis is done, user decides next" | Skill requires tasks.md generation | Generate tasks.md before completing |
| "Findings documented, my job done" | Findings → Tasks → Execution. Documentation alone changes nothing. | Generate tasks.md |
| "Documented findings, job complete" | Tasks.md is mandatory output | Complete Step 6 (tasks.md) |

**Non-negotiable:** These gates exist because specialized agents load Ring standards via WebFetch and have domain expertise. Generic agents do NOT have this capability.

### Execution Checklist - MUST COMPLETE IN ORDER

```
Step 0: [ ] PROJECT_RULES.md exists? → If NO, STOP
Step 1: [ ] Language detected? → go.mod / package.json found
Step 2: [ ] PROJECT_RULES.md read?
Step 3: [ ] 4 agents dispatched in SINGLE message? → If NO, re-dispatch
Step 4: [ ] Agent outputs compiled into analysis-report.md?
Step 5: [ ] Findings grouped into REFACTOR-XXX tasks?
Step 6: [ ] tasks.md generated? → If NO, skill is INCOMPLETE
Step 7: [ ] User approval requested via AskUserQuestion?
Step 8: [ ] Artifacts saved to docs/refactor/{timestamp}/?
Step 9: [ ] Handoff to dev-cycle (if approved)?
```

**SKIP PREVENTION:** You CANNOT proceed to Step N+1 without completing Step N. No exceptions.

#### Prompt Prefix (REQUIRED)

All agent prompts MUST start with:
```
**MODE: ANALYSIS ONLY** - Analyze codebase for refactoring.
Return findings with: severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low), location (file:line), issue, recommendation.
```

#### Example: Go Project Dispatch

```
Task tool calls (SINGLE message, 4 parallel):

1. subagent_type: "ring-dev-team:backend-engineer-golang"
   prompt: "**MODE: ANALYSIS ONLY** - Analyze Go codebase for architecture, code quality, error handling, naming conventions, security..."

2. subagent_type: "ring-dev-team:qa-analyst"
   prompt: "**MODE: ANALYSIS ONLY** - Analyze test coverage (≥80%), test patterns, TDD compliance..."

3. subagent_type: "ring-dev-team:devops-engineer"
   prompt: "**MODE: ANALYSIS ONLY** - Analyze Dockerfile, docker-compose, .env.example..."

4. subagent_type: "ring-dev-team:sre"
   prompt: "**MODE: ANALYSIS ONLY** - Analyze health endpoints, structured logging, tracing..."
```

---

## What This Skill Does

1. **Detects project language** (Go, TypeScript, Python) from manifest files
2. **Reads PROJECT_RULES.md** (project-specific standards - MANDATORY)
3. **Dispatches specialized agents** that load their own Ring standards via WebFetch
4. **Compiles agent findings** into structured analysis report
5. **Generates tasks.md** in the same format as PM Team output
6. **User approves** the plan before execution via dev-cycle

## Foundational Principle

**REFACTORING ANALYSIS IS NOT OPTIONAL FOR CODEBASES WITH TECHNICAL DEBT**

When user requests refactoring or improvement:
1. **NEVER** skip analysis because "code works"
2. **ALWAYS** analyze all 4 dimensions
3. **DOCUMENT** all findings, not just critical
4. **PRESERVE** full analysis even if user filters later

**Cost comparison:**
- Cost of refactoring now: Known, bounded
- Cost of compounding debt: Unknown, unbounded

**Analysis now saves 10x effort later.**

## Analysis-to-Action Pipeline - MANDATORY

**Analysis without action guidance is incomplete:**

| Deliverable | Required? | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| analysis-report.md | ✅ YES | Document findings |
| tasks.md | ✅ YES | Convert findings to actionable tasks |
| User approval prompt | ✅ YES | Get explicit decision on execution |

**Analysis completion checklist:**
- [ ] All 4 dimensions analyzed
- [ ] Findings categorized by severity
- [ ] Findings converted to REFACTOR-XXX tasks
- [ ] tasks.md generated in PM Team format
- [ ] User presented with approval options

**"Analysis complete" means tasks.md exists and user has been asked to approve.**

**If analysis ends without tasks.md:**
1. Analysis is NOT complete
2. Step 6 (Generate tasks.md) was skipped
3. Return to Step 6 before declaring completion

## Analysis Dimensions - ALL REQUIRED

**Every analysis MUST cover all 4 dimensions:**

| Dimension | What It Checks | Skip Allowed? |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Architecture | Patterns, structure, dependencies | ❌ NO |
| Code Quality | Standards compliance, complexity, naming | ❌ NO |
| Testing | Coverage, test quality, TDD compliance | ❌ NO |
| DevOps | Containerization, CI/CD, infrastructure | ❌ NO |

**If user says "only check X":**
- Check X thoroughly
- Check other dimensions briefly
- Report: "Full analysis recommended for dimensions: [Y, Z]"

**NEVER produce partial analysis without noting gaps.**

## Cancellation Documentation - MANDATORY

**If user cancels analysis at approval step:**

1. **ASK:** "Why is analysis being cancelled?"
2. **DOCUMENT:** Save reason to `docs/refactor/{timestamp}/cancelled-reason.md`
3. **PRESERVE:** Keep partial analysis artifacts
4. **NOTE:** "Analysis cancelled by user: [reason]. Partial findings preserved."

**Cancellation without documentation is NOT allowed.**

## Prerequisites

**⛔ See "HARD GATES" section above for mandatory checks.**

Before starting analysis:
1. **Project root identified**: Know where the codebase lives
2. **Language detectable**: Project has go.mod, package.json, or similar manifest
3. **Scope defined**: Full project or specific directories
4. **PROJECT_RULES.md exists**: Gate 1 in HARD GATES section

```

## Step 0: Verify PROJECT_RULES.md Exists

**⛔ See "HARD GATES" section above - Gate 1**

Check for `docs/PROJECT_RULES.md` or `docs/STANDARDS.md`. If neither exists, STOP.

---

## Step 1: Detect Project Language

**⛔ See "HARD GATES" section above - Gate 2 → Agent Selection by Language**

Detect manifest files (`go.mod`, `package.json`) to determine which `ring-dev-team:*` agent to use.

## Step 2: Read PROJECT_RULES.md

**Read the project-specific standards file:**

```text
Action: Use Read tool to load docs/PROJECT_RULES.md

This file contains:
- Project-specific conventions
- Technology stack decisions
- Architecture patterns chosen for THIS project
- Team-specific coding standards
```

**What dev-refactor does NOT do:**
- Does NOT call WebFetch for Ring standards
- Does NOT load golang.md, typescript.md, devops.md, sre.md directly

**Why?** Each specialized agent (devops-engineer, sre, qa-analyst, backend-engineer-*) has its own WebFetch instructions in its agent definition. They load their own standards when dispatched. This avoids duplication and keeps responsibilities clear:

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------------|
| **dev-refactor** | Reads PROJECT_RULES.md (local), dispatches agents, compiles findings |
| **Agents** | Load Ring standards via WebFetch, analyze their dimension, return findings |

**Output of this step:**
- PROJECT_RULES.md content loaded and understood
- Ready to dispatch agents with project context

## Step 3: Scan Codebase

**⛔ See "HARD GATES" section above - Gate 2 → 4-Agent Parallel Dispatch**

Dispatch ALL 4 agents in a SINGLE message:
1. `ring-dev-team:{language-agent}` - Code/Architecture
2. `ring-dev-team:qa-analyst` - Testing
3. `ring-dev-team:devops-engineer` - DevOps
4. `ring-dev-team:sre` - SRE/Observability

All prompts MUST start with `**MODE: ANALYSIS ONLY**`.

**Output:** Dimension-specific findings with severities to compile in Step 4.

## Step 4: Compile Findings

**Collect outputs from all dispatched agents and merge into structured report.**

Each agent returns findings in their output. The dev-refactor skill must:
1. **Collect** all agent outputs (backend-engineer-*, qa-analyst, devops-engineer, sre)
2. **Parse** findings from each output (severity, location, issue, recommendation)
3. **Deduplicate** overlapping findings
4. **Categorize** by dimension (Architecture, Code Quality, Testing, DevOps)
5. **Sort** by severity (Critical → High → Medium → Low)

**Merge results into structured report:**

```markdown
# Analysis Report: {project-name}

**Generated:** {date}
**Standards:** {path to PROJECT_RULES.md used}
**Scope:** {directories analyzed}

## Summary

| Dimension    | Issues | Critical | High | Medium | Low |
|--------------|--------|----------|------|--------|-----|
| Architecture | 12     | 2        | 4    | 4      | 2   |
| Code Quality | 23     | 1        | 8    | 10     | 4   |
| Testing      | 8      | 3        | 3    | 2      | 0   |
| DevOps       | 5      | 0        | 2    | 2      | 1   |
| **Total**    | **48** | **6**    | **17**| **18**| **7**|

## Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

### ARCH-001: Domain depends on infrastructure
**Location:** `src/domain/user.go:15`
**Issue:** Domain entity imports database package
**Standard:** Domain layer must have zero external dependencies
**Fix:** Extract repository interface, inject via constructor

### CODE-001: SQL injection vulnerability
**Location:** `src/handler/search.go:42`
**Issue:** User input concatenated into SQL query
**Standard:** Always use parameterized queries
**Fix:** Use query builder or prepared statements

...

## High Priority Issues
...

## Medium Priority Issues
...

## Low Priority Issues
...
```

## Step 5: Prioritize and Group

Group related issues into logical refactoring tasks:

```text
Grouping Strategy:
1. By bounded context / module
2. By dependency order (fix dependencies first)
3. By risk (critical security first)

Example grouping:
├── REFACTOR-001: Fix domain layer isolation
│   ├── ARCH-001: Remove infra imports from domain
│   ├── ARCH-003: Extract repository interfaces
│   └── ARCH-005: Move domain events to domain layer
│
├── REFACTOR-002: Implement proper error handling
│   ├── CODE-002: Wrap errors with context (15 locations)
│   ├── CODE-007: Replace panic with error returns
│   └── CODE-012: Add custom domain error types
│
├── REFACTOR-003: Add missing test coverage
│   ├── TEST-001: User service unit tests
│   ├── TEST-002: Order handler tests
│   └── TEST-003: Repository integration tests
│
└── REFACTOR-004: Containerization improvements
    ├── DEVOPS-001: Add multi-stage Dockerfile
    └── DEVOPS-002: Create docker-compose.yml
```

## Step 6: Generate tasks.md

Create refactoring tasks in the same format as PM Team output:

```markdown
# Refactoring Tasks: {project-name}

**Source:** Analysis Report {date}
**Total Tasks:** {count}
**Estimated Effort:** {total hours}

---

## REFACTOR-001: Fix domain layer isolation

**Type:** backend
**Effort:** 4h
**Priority:** Critical
**Dependencies:** none

### Description
Remove infrastructure dependencies from domain layer and establish proper
port/adapter boundaries following hexagonal architecture.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AC-1: Domain package has zero imports from infrastructure
- [ ] AC-2: Repository interfaces defined in domain layer
- [ ] AC-3: All domain entities use dependency injection
- [ ] AC-4: Existing tests still pass

### Technical Notes
- Files to modify: src/domain/*.go
- Pattern: See PROJECT_RULES.md → Hexagonal Architecture section
- Related issues: ARCH-001, ARCH-003, ARCH-005

### Issues Addressed
| ID | Description | Location |
|----|-------------|----------|
| ARCH-001 | Domain imports database | src/domain/user.go:15 |

---

## REFACTOR-002: Implement proper error handling

**Type:** backend
**Effort:** 3h
**Priority:** High
**Dependencies:** REFACTOR-001

### Description
Standardize error handling across the codebase following Go idioms
and project standards.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AC-1: All errors wrapped with context using fmt.Errorf
- [ ] AC-2: No panic() outside of main.go
- [ ] AC-3: Custom error types for domain errors
- [ ] AC-4: Error handling tests added

### Technical Notes
- Use errors.Is/As for error checking
- See PROJECT_RULES.md → Error Handling section

### Issues Addressed
| ID | Description | Location |
|----|-------------|----------|
| CODE-002 | Unwrapped errors | 15 locations |
| CODE-007 | panic in business logic | src/service/order.go:78 |
| CODE-012 | No domain error types | src/domain/ |

## REFACTOR-003: Add missing test coverage
...

---

## REFACTOR-004: Containerization improvements
...
```

## Step 7: User Approval

Present the generated plan and ask for approval using AskUserQuestion tool:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  questions:
    - question: "Review the refactoring plan. How do you want to proceed?"
      header: "Approval"
      multiSelect: false
      options:
        - label: "Approve all"
          description: "Save tasks.md, proceed to dev-cycle execution"
        - label: "Approve with changes"
          description: "Let user edit tasks.md first, then proceed"
        - label: "Critical only"
          description: "Filter to only Critical/High priority tasks"
        - label: "Cancel"
          description: "Abort execution, keep analysis report only"
```

## Step 8: Save Artifacts

Save analysis report and tasks to project:

```text
docs/refactor/{timestamp}/
├── analysis-report.md    # Full analysis with all findings
├── tasks.md              # Approved refactoring tasks
└── project-rules-used.md # Copy of PROJECT_RULES.md at time of analysis
```

**Note:** Ring standards are not saved as they are loaded dynamically by agents via WebFetch. Only the project-specific rules are preserved for reference.

## Step 9: Handoff to dev-cycle

If approved, the workflow continues:

```bash
# Automatic handoff
/ring-dev-team:dev-cycle docs/refactor/{timestamp}/tasks.md
```

This executes each refactoring task through the standard 6-gate process:
- Gate 0: Implementation (TDD)
- Gate 1: DevOps Setup
- Gate 2: SRE (Observability)
- Gate 3: Testing
- Gate 4: Review (3 parallel reviewers)
- Gate 5: Validation (user approval)

## Output Schema

```yaml
output_schema:
  format: "markdown"
  artifacts:
    - name: "analysis-report.md"
      location: "docs/refactor/{timestamp}/"
      required: true
    - name: "tasks.md"
      location: "docs/refactor/{timestamp}/"
      required: true
  required_sections:
    - name: "Summary"
      pattern: "^## Summary"
      required: true
    - name: "Critical Issues"
      pattern: "^## Critical Issues"
      required: true
    - name: "Tasks Generated"
      pattern: "^## REFACTOR-"
      required: true
```

## Example Usage

```bash
# Full project analysis
/ring-dev-team:dev-refactor

# Analyze specific directory
/ring-dev-team:dev-refactor src/domain

# Analyze with custom standards
/ring-dev-team:dev-refactor --standards path/to/PROJECT_RULES.md

# Analysis only (no execution)
/ring-dev-team:dev-refactor --analyze-only
```

## Related Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `ring-dev-team:dev-cycle` | Executes refactoring tasks through 6 gates (after approval) |

## Key Principles

1. **Same workflow**: Refactoring uses the same dev-cycle as new features
2. **Separation of concerns**: dev-refactor reads PROJECT_RULES.md locally; agents load Ring standards via WebFetch
3. **Standards-driven**: Analysis combines project-specific rules (PROJECT_RULES.md) + Ring standards (loaded by agents)
4. **Traceable**: Every task links back to specific issues found
5. **Incremental**: Can approve subset of tasks (critical only, etc.)
6. **Reversible**: Original analysis preserved for reference
