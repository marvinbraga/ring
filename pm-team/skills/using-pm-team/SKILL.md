description: Pre-dev workflow skills for feature planning - organize requirements, architecture, APIs, data models, dependencies, and tasks before implementation
when_to_use: Before starting implementation of any feature - use to systematically plan through 8 gates (or 3 for simple features) to create executable implementation plans

# Using Ring Team-Product: Pre-Dev Workflow

The ring-pm-team plugin provides 8 pre-development planning skills. Use them via `Skill tool: "ring-pm-team:gate-name"` or via slash commands.

**Remember:** Follow the **ORCHESTRATOR principle** from `using-ring`. Dispatch pre-dev workflow to handle planning; plan thoroughly before coding.

---

## Pre-Dev Philosophy

**Before you code, you plan. Every time.**

Pre-dev workflow ensures:
- ✅ Requirements are clear (WHAT/WHY)
- ✅ Architecture is sound (HOW)
- ✅ APIs are contracts (boundaries)
- ✅ Data models are explicit (entities)
- ✅ Dependencies are known (tech choices)
- ✅ Tasks are atomic (2-5 min each)
- ✅ Implementation is execution, not design

---

## Two Tracks: Choose Your Path

### Small Track (3 Gates) – <2 Day Features

**Use when ALL criteria met:**
- ✅ Implementation: <2 days
- ✅ No new external dependencies

## Using Pre-Dev Workflow

### Via Slash Commands (Easy)

**Small feature:**
```
/ring:pre-dev-feature logout-button
```

**Large feature:**
```
/ring:pre-dev-full payment-system
```

These run all gates sequentially and create artifacts in `docs/pre-dev/{feature}/`.

---

### Via Skills (Manual)

Run individually or sequence:

```
Skill tool: "ring-pm-team:pre-dev-prd-creation"
(Review output)

Skill tool: "ring-pm-team:pre-dev-trd-creation"
(Review output)

Skill tool: "ring-pm-team:pre-dev-task-breakdown"
(Review output)
```

## Pre-Dev Output Structure

```
docs/pre-dev/{feature}/
├── PRD.md                 # Gate 1: Business requirements
├── feature-map.md         # Gate 2: Feature relationships (large only)
├── TRD.md                 # Gate 3: Technical architecture
├── API.md                 # Gate 4: API contracts (large only)
├── data-model.md          # Gate 5: Entity schemas (large only)
├── dependencies.md        # Gate 6: Tech choices (large only)
├── tasks.md               # Gate 7: Implementation tasks
└── subtasks.md            # Gate 8: Ultra-atomic tasks (large only)
```

---

## Decision: Small or Large Track?

**When in doubt: Use Large Track.**

Better to over-plan than discover mid-implementation that feature is larger.

**You can switch:** If Small Track feature grows, pause and complete Large Track gates.

---

## Integration with Other Planning

**Pre-dev workflow provides:**
- ✅ Complete planning artifacts
- ✅ Atomic tasks ready to execute
- ✅ Zero-context handoff capability
- ✅ Clear implementation boundaries

**Combined with:**
- `ring-default:execute-plan` – Run tasks in batches
- `ring-default:write-plan` – Generate from scratch
- `ring-dev-team:*-engineer` – Specialist review of design
- `ring-default:requesting-code-review` – Post-implementation review

---

## ORCHESTRATOR Principle

Remember:
- **You're the orchestrator** – Dispatch pre-dev skills, don't plan manually
- **Don't skip gates** – Each gate adds clarity
- **Don't code without planning** – Plan first, code second
- **Use agents for specialist review** – Dispatch backend-engineer-golang to review TRD

### Good Example (ORCHESTRATOR):
> "I need to plan payment system. Let me run /ring:pre-dev-full to get organized, then dispatch backend-engineer-golang to review the architecture."

### Bad Example (OPERATOR):
> "I'll start coding and plan as I go."
