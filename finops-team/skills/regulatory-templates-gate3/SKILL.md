# Regulatory Templates - Gate 3: Template File Generation

## Overview

**This sub-skill executes Gate 3 of the regulatory template workflow: generating the complete .tpl template file with all validated mappings and transformations from Gates 1-2.**

**Parent skill:** `regulatory-templates`

**Prerequisites:**
- Gate 1 PASSED (field mappings complete)
- Gate 2 PASSED (validations confirmed)
- Context object with Gates 1-2 results

**Output:** Generated .tpl template file ready for use

---

## Foundational Principle

**Template generation is the final quality gate before production deployment.**

Gate 3 transforms validated specifications into production artifacts:
- **Agent-based generation**: finops-automation applies validated mappings consistently - manual creation introduces human error
- **Two-file separation**: Clean .tpl (production code) + .tpl.docs (documentation) - inline comments bloat production artifacts
- **All mandatory fields**: 100% inclusion required - 95% = 5% of regulatory data missing in BACEN submission
- **Correct transformations**: Django filters applied per Gates 1-2 validation - errors here multiply in every submission
- **Valid syntax**: Template must execute without errors - syntax failures block Reporter deployment

**Skipping requirements in Gate 3 means:**
- Manual creation bypasses systematic validation (fatigue errors, missed transformations)
- Single-file output mixes production code with documentation (maintenance nightmare)
- Missing fields cause BACEN submission failures (compliance violations)
- Invalid syntax blocks deployment (emergency fixes under pressure)

**Gate 3 is not automation for convenience - it's the final verification layer.**

---

## When to Use

**Called by:** `regulatory-templates` skill after Gate 2 passes

**Purpose:** Create the final Django/Jinja2 template file with all field mappings, transformations, and validation logic

---

## NO EXCEPTIONS - Generation Requirements Are Mandatory

**Gate 3 template generation requirements have ZERO exceptions.** This is the final artifact that goes to production.

### Common Pressures You Must Resist

| Pressure | Your Thought | Reality |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Fatigue** | "Manual creation is faster when tired" | Fatigue increases error rate. Agent doesn't get tired. 10 min manual < 15 min validated |
| **Simplicity** | "One file easier than two" | Production artifacts must be clean. Documentation bloats .tpl files |
| **Confidence** | "45/47 fields works for 99% cases" | 100% mandatory required. 95% = BACEN submission failures on edge cases |
| **Experience** | "I can optimize agent output" | Agent applies validated mappings systematically. Manual edits introduce drift |

### Generation Requirements (Non-Negotiable)

**Agent-Based Generation:**
- ✅ REQUIRED: Use finops-automation agent for all template generation
- ❌ FORBIDDEN: Manual .tpl creation, editing agent output
- Why: Agent applies Gates 1-2 validations consistently, prevents fatigue errors

**Two-File Output:**
- ✅ REQUIRED: Generate .tpl (clean code) + .tpl.docs (documentation)
- ❌ FORBIDDEN: Single file with inline comments, merged documentation
- Why: Production artifacts stay clean, documentation separate for maintenance

**All Mandatory Fields:**
- ✅ REQUIRED: 100% mandatory fields in template (47/47)
- ❌ FORBIDDEN: "45/47 is good enough", placeholder comments for missing
- Why: Each missing field = potential regulatory compliance failure

**Validated Output:**
- ✅ REQUIRED: Use exact agent output without manual "improvements"
- ❌ FORBIDDEN: Refactoring for optimization, rewriting for clarity
- Why: Agent output validated against Gates 1-2, edits create drift

### The Bottom Line

**Manual shortcuts in final artifact = production regulatory failures.**

Gate 3 is the last checkpoint. All previous gates' work culminates here. Bypassing agent generation defeats the entire 3-gate validation process.

**If you're tempted to skip agent generation, ask yourself: Am I willing to debug production BACEN submission failures from manual template errors?**

## Rationalization Table - Know the Excuses

| Excuse | Why It's Wrong | Correct Response |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| "Manual creation same output, faster" | Agent validates systematically, manual risks errors | Use agent completely |
| "10 min vs 15 min, I'm tired" | Fatigue increases manual error rate | Let agent work |
| "Two files is over-engineering" | Production code must be clean, no doc bloat | Generate TWO files |
| "One file easier to maintain" | Mixing code and docs creates maintenance burden | Separate concerns |
| "45/47 works for 99% cases" | 100% mandatory required, edge cases matter | Include ALL fields |
| "I can optimize agent output" | Optimization creates drift from validated spec | Use exact output |
| "Agent code is verbose" | Verbose but validated > concise but wrong | Trust validation |
| "Skip for now, add fields later" | Template is final artifact, can't patch BACEN | Complete now |

### If You Find Yourself Making These Excuses

**STOP. You are rationalizing.**

Gate 3 is where 5+ hours of Gates 1-2 work becomes a production artifact. Shortcuts here waste all previous validation effort.

## Gate 3 Process

### Agent Dispatch

**Use the Task tool to dispatch the finops-automation agent for template generation:**

1. **Invoke the Task tool with these parameters:**
   - `subagent_type`: "finops-automation"
   - `model`: "sonnet"
   - `description`: "Gate 3: Generate template file"
   - `prompt`: Use the prompt template below with accumulated context from Gates 1-2

2. **Prompt Template for Gate 3:**

```
GATE 3: TEMPLATE FILE GENERATION

CONTEXT FROM GATES 1-2:
- Template: [insert context.template_name]
- Template Code: [insert context.template_code]
- Authority: [insert context.authority]
- Fields Mapped: [insert context.field_mappings.length]
- Validation Rules: [insert context.validation_rules.length]

FIELD MAPPINGS FROM GATE 1:
[For each field in context.field_mappings, list:]
Field [field_code]: [field_name]
- Source: [selected_mapping]
- Transformation: [transformation or 'none']
- Confidence: [confidence_score]%
- Required: [required]

VALIDATION RULES FROM GATE 2:
[For each rule in context.validation_rules, list:]
Rule [rule_id]: [description]
- Formula: [formula]

TASKS:
1. Generate CLEAN .tpl file with ONLY Django/Jinja2 template code
2. Include all field mappings with transformations
3. Apply correct template syntax for Reporter
4. Structure according to regulatory format requirements
5. Include conditional logic where needed
6. Use MINIMAL inline comments (max 1-2 lines critical notes only)

CRITICAL - NAMING CONVENTION:
⚠️ ALL field names are in SNAKE_CASE standard
- Gate 1 has already converted all fields to snake_case
- Examples:
  * Use {{ legal_document }} (converted from legalDocument)
  * Use {{ operation_route }} (already snake_case)
  * Use {{ opening_date }} (converted from openingDate)
  * Use {{ natural_person }} (converted from naturalPerson)
- ALL fields follow snake_case convention consistently
- No conversion needed - fields arrive already standardized

CRITICAL - DATA SOURCES:
⚠️ ALWAYS prefix fields with the correct data source!
Reference: /docs/regulatory/DATA_SOURCES.md

Available Data Sources:
- midaz_onboarding: organization, account (cadastral data)
- midaz_transaction: operation_route, balance, operation (transactional data)

Field Path Format: {data_source}.{entity}.{index?}.{field}

Examples:
- CNPJ: {{ midaz_onboarding.organization.0.legal_document|slice:':8' }}
- COSIF: {{ midaz_transaction.operation_route.code }}
- Saldo: {{ midaz_transaction.balance.available }}
- Data: {% date_time "YYYY/MM" %}

WRONG: {{ organization.legal_document }}
CORRECT: {{ midaz_onboarding.organization.0.legal_document }}

TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:
- Use proper hierarchy per regulatory spec
- Include loops for repeating elements (accounts, transactions)
- Apply transformations using Django filters
- NO DOCUMENTATION BLOCKS - only functional template code

OUTPUT FILES (Generate TWO separate files):

FILE 1 - TEMPLATE (CLEAN):
- Filename: [template_code]_preview.tpl
- Content: ONLY the Django/Jinja2 template code
- NO extensive comments or documentation blocks
- Maximum 1-2 critical inline comments if absolutely necessary
- Ready for DIRECT use in Reporter without editing

FILE 2 - DOCUMENTATION:
- Filename: [template_code]_preview.tpl.docs
- Content: Full documentation including:
  * Field mappings table
  * Transformation rules
  * Validation checklist
  * Troubleshooting guide
  * Maintenance notes
  * All the helpful documentation

CRITICAL: The .tpl file must be production-ready and contain ONLY
the functional template code. All documentation goes in .docs file.

COMPLETION STATUS must be COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE.
```

3. **Example Task tool invocation:**
```
When executing Gate 3, call the Task tool with:
- subagent_type: "finops-automation"
- model: "sonnet"
- description: "Gate 3: Generate template file"
- prompt: [The full prompt above with context from Gates 1-2 substituted]
```
```

---

## Agent Execution

The agent `finops-automation` will handle all technical aspects:

- Analyze template requirements based on authority type
- Generate appropriate template structure (XML, JSON, etc.)
- Apply all necessary transformations using Django/Jinja2 filters
- Include conditional logic for business rules
- Ensure compliance with regulatory format specifications

---

## Expected Output

The agent will generate two files:

1. **Template File**: `{template_code}_{timestamp}_preview.tpl`
   - Contains the functional Django/Jinja2 template code
   - Ready for direct use in Reporter
   - Minimal inline comments only if necessary

2. **Documentation File**: `{template_code}_{timestamp}_preview.tpl.docs`
   - Contains full documentation
   - Field mapping details
   - Maintenance notes

## Red Flags - STOP Immediately

If you catch yourself thinking ANY of these, STOP and re-read the NO EXCEPTIONS section:

### Manual Shortcuts
- "Create .tpl manually, faster"
- "Edit agent output for optimization"
- "I can write cleaner code"
- "Agent is too verbose"

### File Structure Violations
- "One file easier to maintain"
- "Inline comments instead of .docs"
- "Merge documentation into .tpl"
- "Two files is over-engineering"

### Partial Completion
- "45/47 fields works for most cases"
- "Skip edge case fields"
- "Add missing fields later"
- "99% is good enough"

### Justification Language
- "Being pragmatic"
- "I'm too tired for agent wait"
- "Manual is faster"
- "Over-engineering"
- "Optimization is better"

### If You See These Red Flags

1. **Acknowledge rationalization** ("I'm trying to skip agent generation")
2. **Read NO EXCEPTIONS** (understand why agent is required)
3. **Read Rationalization Table** (see excuse refuted)
4. **Use agent completely** (no manual shortcuts)

**Template generation shortcuts waste all Gates 1-2 validation work.**

## Common Template Patterns

### SNAKE_CASE Field Names (STANDARD)
```django
CORRECT - All fields in snake_case (as provided by Gate 1):
{{ organization.legal_document }}  # Converted from legalDocument
{{ holder.natural_person }}        # Already snake_case
{{ account.opening_date }}          # Converted from openingDate
{{ banking_details.account_number }} # Converted from accountNumber

WRONG - Using other naming conventions:
{{ organization.legalDocument }}   # ❌ Should be legal_document
{{ holder.naturalPerson }}         # ❌ Should be natural_person
{{ account.openingDate }}          # ❌ Should be opening_date
{{ bankingDetails.accountNumber }} # ❌ Should be banking_details.account_number
```

### Iterating Collections
```django
{% for item in collection %}
    {{ item.field }}
{% endfor %}
```

### Conditional Fields
```django
{% if condition %}
    <field>{{ value }}</field>
{% endif %}
```

### Nested Objects
```django
{{ parent.child.grandchild }}
```

### Filters Chain
```django
{{ value|slice:':8'|upper }}
```

## Remember

1. **Use exact field paths** from Gate 1 mappings
2. **ALL FIELDS IN SNAKE_CASE** - Gate 1 provides all fields already converted to snake_case
3. **Apply all transformations** validated in Gate 2
4. **Include comments** for maintainability
5. **Follow regulatory format** exactly
6. **Test syntax validity** before saving
7. **Document assumptions** made during generation
8. **Fields are standardized** - All fields follow snake_case convention consistently
