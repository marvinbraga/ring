# Checksums for codereview tool dependencies
# Format: tool_name: sha256_checksum
#
# IMPORTANT: These are PLACEHOLDER values. You must generate real checksums
# after installing tools from a trusted source.
#
# To generate real checksums:
#   1. Install tools on a trusted, clean system
#   2. Verify the tools work correctly
#   3. Run: ./install.sh generate-checksums
#
# The checksums below are architecture and OS-specific.
# You may need separate checksum files for different platforms.
#
# Note: Go binaries are compiled locally by 'go install', so checksums
# will vary based on Go version, OS, and architecture. Consider using
# official pre-built binaries for reproducible checksums.

# Go tools (architecture-dependent, update after trusted install)
