# TDD Prompt Templates

Canonical source for TDD dispatch prompts used by dev-cycle and dev-implementation skills.

## Standards Loading (MANDATORY - Before TDD)

**Before dispatching any TDD phase, the agent MUST load:**

1. **Ring Standards** (MANDATORY) → Base technical patterns (architecture, error handling, logging, testing)
2. **PROJECT_RULES.md** (COMPLEMENTARY) → Project-specific info not in Ring Standards

**Priority:** Ring Standards define HOW to implement. PROJECT_RULES.md defines project-specific context only.

See [standards-workflow.md](./standards-workflow.md) for the complete loading process.

### What Each Source Provides (no OVERLAP)

| Source | Provides | Examples |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Ring Standards** | Technical patterns | Error handling, logging, testing, architecture, lib-commons, API structure |
| **PROJECT_RULES.md** | Project-specific only | External APIs, non-standard dirs, domain terminology, tech not in Ring |

**⛔ PROJECT_RULES.md MUST not duplicate Ring Standards content.**

## TDD-RED Phase Prompt Template

```markdown
**TDD-RED PHASE only** for: [unit_id] - [title]

**MANDATORY:** WebFetch Ring Standards for your language FIRST (see standards-workflow.md)

**Requirements:**
[requirements from task/subtask file]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
[acceptance_criteria]

**PROJECT CONTEXT (if PROJECT_RULES.md exists):**
[Insert relevant project-specific info: tech stack, internal libs, conventions]

**INSTRUCTIONS (TDD-RED):**
1. Follow Ring Standards for test structure and patterns
2. Write a failing test that captures the expected behavior
3. Run the test
4. **CAPTURE THE FAILURE OUTPUT** - this is MANDATORY

**STOP AFTER RED PHASE.** Do not write implementation code.

**REQUIRED OUTPUT:**
- Test file path
- Test function name
- **FAILURE OUTPUT** (copy/paste the actual test failure)

Example failure output:
```text
=== FAIL: TestUserAuthentication (0.00s)
    auth_test.go:15: expected token to be valid, got nil
```
```

## TDD-GREEN Phase Prompt Template

```markdown
**TDD-GREEN PHASE** for: [unit_id] - [title]

**MANDATORY:** WebFetch Ring Standards for your language FIRST (see standards-workflow.md)

**CONTEXT FROM TDD-RED:**
- Test file: [tdd_red.test_file]
- Failure output: [tdd_red.failure_output]

**PROJECT CONTEXT (if PROJECT_RULES.md exists):**
[Insert relevant project-specific info: tech stack, internal libs, conventions]

## ⛔ CRITICAL: all Ring Standards Apply from Task 1 (no DEFERRAL)

**See [shared-anti-rationalization.md](./shared-anti-rationalization.md) → "Standards Deferral Anti-Rationalizations" section.**

**Summary:** Ring Standards are not phased. They apply IMMEDIATELY to every task. PM defines WHAT, Ring Standards define HOW.

**⛔ HARD GATE:** If you output "DEFERRED" regarding any Ring Standard → Implementation is INCOMPLETE. Fix before proceeding.

**INSTRUCTIONS (TDD-GREEN):**
1. Follow Ring Standards for architecture, error handling, and patterns
2. Write MINIMAL code to make the test pass
3. Apply project-specific conventions from PROJECT_RULES.md (if exists)
4. Run the test
5. **CAPTURE THE PASS OUTPUT** - this is MANDATORY
6. Refactor if needed (keeping tests green)
7. **VERIFY STANDARDS COMPLIANCE** - Complete the checklist below
8. Commit

**⛔ RING STANDARDS REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY - all MUST BE IMPLEMENTED):**

**You MUST WebFetch and implement all sections from Ring Standards for your language:**
- **Go:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/golang.md`
- **TypeScript:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/typescript.md`

**⛔ HARD GATE: You MUST implement all sections listed in [standards-coverage-table.md](../shared-patterns/standards-coverage-table.md).**

- **Go projects:** See `backend-engineer-golang → golang.md` section index (20 sections)
- **TypeScript projects:** See `backend-engineer-typescript → typescript.md` section index (13 sections)

**You CANNOT skip any section. Mark N/A only with explicit justification.**

**PROJECT-SPECIFIC (from PROJECT_RULES.md, if exists):**
- Use internal libraries referenced in PROJECT_RULES.md
- Follow project-specific naming conventions (if different from Ring Standards)
- Use tech stack choices defined in PROJECT_RULES.md (database, frameworks, etc.)

**⛔ REQUIRED OUTPUT (HARD GATE - all SECTIONS MANDATORY):**

## Implementation Summary
- Implementation file path: [path]
- Files changed: [list]
- Commit SHA: [sha]

## Test Results
**PASS OUTPUT** (copy/paste the actual test pass):
```text
[paste actual output here]
```

## Standards Coverage Table

**You MUST output a Standards Coverage Table per [shared-patterns/standards-coverage-table.md](../shared-patterns/standards-coverage-table.md).**

**Format:**
```markdown
| # | Section (from standards-coverage-table.md) | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------------------------------------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | [Section Name] | ✅/❌ | [file:line] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

**Status Legend:**
- ✅ Implemented - Code follows this standard (with file:line evidence)
- ❌ Not Implemented - Missing or incorrect (BLOCKS proceeding)
- N/A - Not applicable (with reason)

## Compliance Summary
- **all STANDARDS MET:** ✅ YES / ❌ no
- **If no, what's missing:** [list missing items with section names]

**⛔ if "all STANDARDS MET" = no → Implementation is INCOMPLETE. Fix before proceeding.**

Example pass output:
```text
=== PASS: TestUserAuthentication (0.003s)
PASS
ok      myapp/auth    0.015s
```
```

## HARD GATE Verifications

### After TDD-RED

```text
if failure_output is empty or contains "PASS":
  → STOP. Cannot proceed. "TDD-RED incomplete - no failure output captured"
```

### After TDD-GREEN

```text
if pass_output is empty or contains "FAIL":
  → Return to TDD-GREEN (retry implementation)
  → Max 3 retries, then STOP and report blocker

if "all STANDARDS MET" = no:
  → STOP. Cannot proceed to Gate 1.
  → Re-dispatch to same agent with fix request:
    "Fix missing standards: [list from compliance checklist]"
  → Max 3 retries, then STOP and report blocker
```

### Standards Compliance Verification (HARD GATE)

**The orchestrator MUST verify the agent's Standards Coverage Table before proceeding:**

### Anti-Rationalization for Standards Compliance

See [shared-patterns/standards-coverage-table.md](../shared-patterns/standards-coverage-table.md) for the complete anti-rationalization table.

**Key rules:**
- all sections from standards-coverage-table.md MUST be checked
- ❌ on any section = BLOCKED (dispatch fix to same agent)
- N/A requires explicit reason
- Evidence (file:line) REQUIRED for all ✅ items

---

## ⛔ Orchestrator Enforcement (HARD GATE)

**This section defines what the ORCHESTRATOR (dev-cycle, dev-implementation) MUST do after receiving agent output.**

### Verification Applies To all Gates

| Gate | Agent | Orchestrator Verifies |
|------|-------|----------------------|
| Gate 0 (Implementation) | backend-engineer-*, frontend-* | Standards Coverage Table from TDD-GREEN |
| Gate 1 (DevOps) | devops-engineer | Standards Coverage Table from artifacts |
| Gate 2 (SRE) | sre | Standards Coverage Table from validation |
| Gate 3 (Testing) | qa-analyst | Standards Coverage Table from test analysis |

### State Update After Verification

```json
{
  "gate_progress": {
    "[gate_name]": {
      "status": "completed",
      "standards_verified": true,
      "standards_coverage": {
        "total_sections": 20,
        "compliant": 18,
        "not_applicable": 2,
        "non_compliant": 0
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Anti-Rationalization for Orchestrator

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Agent said it's complete" | Agent completion ≠ Standards compliance. Verify table. | **Parse and verify Standards Coverage Table** |
| "Table wasn't in output" | Missing table = Incomplete output = BLOCKED | **Re-dispatch agent** |
| "Only 1-2 sections are ❌" | any ❌ = BLOCKED. Count is irrelevant. | **Re-dispatch to fix all ❌** |
| "Agent knows the standards" | Knowledge ≠ implementation. Verify evidence. | **Check file:line evidence in table** |
| "Verification is slow" | Verification prevents rework. 30 seconds now vs hours later. | **Always verify** |
| "Trust the agent" | Trust but verify. Standards Coverage Table IS the verification. | **Parse the table** |

## Standards Priority Summary

### Ring Standards (MANDATORY - Base patterns)

| What | Source | Defines |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Architecture patterns** | Ring Standards | Hexagonal, Clean Architecture, DDD |
| **Error handling** | Ring Standards | No panic, wrap with context |
| **Logging** | Ring Standards | Structured JSON (zerolog/zap or pino/winston) |
| **Tracing** | Ring Standards | OpenTelemetry spans, trace_id propagation |
| **Testing patterns** | Ring Standards | Table-driven tests, mocking |

### PROJECT_RULES.md (COMPLEMENTARY - only What Ring Does not Cover)

| What | Source | Defines |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Tech stack not in Ring** | PROJECT_RULES.md | Specific message broker, cache, DB if not PostgreSQL |
| **Non-standard directories** | PROJECT_RULES.md | Workers, consumers, polling (not standard API structure) |
| **External integrations** | PROJECT_RULES.md | Third-party APIs, webhooks, external services |
| **Domain terminology** | PROJECT_RULES.md | Technical names of entities/classes in this codebase |

**⛔ PROJECT_RULES.md MUST not contain:**
- Error handling patterns (Ring covers this)
- Logging standards (Ring covers this)
- Testing patterns (Ring covers this)
- Architecture patterns (Ring covers this)
- lib-commons usage (Ring covers this)
- Business rules (belongs in PRD/product docs)

**Priority:** Ring Standards > PROJECT_RULES.md (project adds context, not patterns)

**Gate 0 implements standards + observability. Gate 2 (SRE) validates observability.**
