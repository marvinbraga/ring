description: |
  Orchestrates infrastructure cost estimation with per-component sharing model.
  Skill discovers components, asks shared/dedicated for EACH, selects environment(s),
  reads actual Helm chart configs, then dispatches agent for accurate calculations.

trigger: |
  - "How much will this cost on AWS?"
  - "Estimate infrastructure for [repo]"
  - "What should we charge the customer?"
  - "Is this deal profitable?"
  - Adding new customer to platform

skip_when: |
  - No docker-compose in repo → manual estimation needed
  - Non-AWS target → adapt pricing

## Step 1: Select Products for This Customer

**Ask which products the customer needs:**

| Product | Selection | Sharing | Services |
|---------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Access Manager** | ALWAYS INCLUDED | ALWAYS SHARED | identity, auth |
| **Midaz Core** | Required | Customer choice | onboarding, transaction, ledger, crm |
| **Reporter** | Optional | Customer choice | manager, worker, frontend |

**Use AskUserQuestion for product selection:**
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Which products does this customer need? (Access Manager is always included)"
  header: "Products"
  multiSelect: true
  options:
    - label: "Midaz Core + Reporter (Recommended)"
      description: "Full platform: ledger + regulatory reporting"
    - label: "Midaz Core only"
      description: "Base ledger platform without reporting"
```

**Product → Helm Chart Mapping:**

| Product | Helm Chart | Always Read |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Access Manager | `charts/plugin-access-manager/values.yaml` | YES (always shared) |
| Midaz Core | `charts/midaz/values.yaml` | If selected |
| Reporter | `charts/reporter/values.yaml` | If selected |

---

## Step 2: Gather Basic Information

| Input | Required | Question | Example |
|-------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Repo Path** | Yes | "What is the application repository path?" | `/workspace/midaz` |
| **Helm Charts Repo** | Optional | "Path to LerianStudio/helm repository?" | `/workspace/helm` |
| **TPS** | Yes | "What is the expected TPS?" | `100` |
| **Total Customers** | Yes | "How many customers share the platform?" | `5` |

**Why Helm Charts Repo?** LerianStudio/helm contains actual CPU/memory configurations per service. Without it, the agent uses Midaz default values.

---

## Step 3: Select Environment(s) to Calculate

**Ask which environments need cost estimation:**

| Environment | Region | Configuration | Use Case |
|-------------|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Homolog** | us-east-2 (Ohio) | Single-AZ, 1 replica, ~35% cheaper | Testing, staging |
| **Production** | sa-east-1 (São Paulo) | Multi-AZ, 3 replicas, full HA | Live traffic |

**Use AskUserQuestion for environment selection:**
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Which environments should be estimated?"
  header: "Environments"
  multiSelect: true
  options:
    - label: "Both (Recommended)"
      description: "Calculate Homolog + Production costs for complete picture"
    - label: "Production only"
      description: "Calculate only production environment (São Paulo)"
    - label: "Homolog only"
      description: "Calculate only homolog/staging environment (Ohio)"
```

**Environment Differences:**

| Aspect | Homolog | Production |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Region** | us-east-2 (Ohio) | sa-east-1 (São Paulo) |
| **Pricing** | ~35% cheaper | Full price |
| **Replicas** | 1 per service | 3 per service (HA) |
| **Database** | Single-AZ | Multi-AZ + Read Replicas |
| **NAT Gateways** | 1 (single AZ) | 3 (one per AZ) |

---

## Step 4: Read Selected Product Helm Charts

### 4a. Always Read Access Manager (ALWAYS SHARED)

**Access Manager is platform-level infrastructure - ALWAYS included, ALWAYS shared across all customers.**

```
ALWAYS READ: charts/plugin-access-manager/values.yaml

Services:
- identity (100m CPU, 128Mi memory)
- auth (500m CPU, 256Mi memory)

Infrastructure (shared):
- auth-database (PostgreSQL for Casdoor)
- valkey (session cache)
```

**Cost Attribution:** Access Manager costs are ALWAYS divided by total platform customers.

### 4b. Read Selected Products (Based on Step 1)

**Read ONLY the Helm charts for products selected in Step 1:**

| Product Selected | Helm Chart to Read | Services |
|------------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Midaz Core** (if selected) | `charts/midaz/values.yaml` | onboarding, transaction, ledger, crm |
| **Reporter** (if selected) | `charts/reporter/values.yaml` | manager, worker, frontend |

**Example - Customer selected "Midaz Core + Reporter":**
```
Read: charts/plugin-access-manager/values.yaml  → ALWAYS (shared platform)
Read: charts/midaz/values.yaml                  → Selected
Read: charts/reporter/values.yaml               → Selected
```

**Example - Customer selected "Midaz Core only":**
```
Read: charts/plugin-access-manager/values.yaml  → ALWAYS (shared platform)
Read: charts/midaz/values.yaml                  → Selected
Skip: charts/reporter/values.yaml               → Not selected
```

### 4c. Extract Resource Configurations

**Source:** `git@github.com:LerianStudio/helm.git`

**For each service, extract:**
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: ???m      # CPU request in millicores
    memory: ???Mi  # Memory request
autoscaling:
  minReplicas: ?   # Minimum replicas
  maxReplicas: ?   # Maximum replicas
```

**Example from LerianStudio/helm values.yaml:**
```yaml
transaction:
  replicaCount: 3
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 2000m
      memory: 512Mi
    limits:
      cpu: 2000m
      memory: 512Mi
  autoscaling:
    enabled: true
    minReplicas: 3
    maxReplicas: 9
```

**If no Helm repo available**, use Midaz default values from this document.

### 4d. Read Actual Resources (DYNAMIC - from LerianStudio/helm)

**MUST read actual values at runtime - DO NOT use hardcoded values.**

**Source Repository:** `git@github.com:LerianStudio/helm.git`

**Files to Read:**

| Chart | Path | Services |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Midaz Core** | `charts/midaz/values.yaml` | onboarding, transaction, ledger, crm |
| **Reporter** | `charts/reporter/values.yaml` | manager, worker, frontend |
| **Access Manager** | `charts/plugin-access-manager/values.yaml` | identity, auth |

**What to Extract per Service:**

```yaml
# For each service, extract:
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: ???m      # CPU request in millicores
    memory: ???Mi  # Memory request
  limits:
    cpu: ???m      # CPU limit
    memory: ???Mi  # Memory limit

autoscaling:
  minReplicas: ?   # Minimum replicas
  maxReplicas: ?   # Maximum replicas

# For databases (postgresql, mongodb, valkey, rabbitmq):
# Look for resourcesPreset or explicit resources block
```

**How to Read:**

1. If local clone exists: `Read tool` on values.yaml files
2. If no local clone: `WebFetch` from GitHub raw URLs:
   - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/helm/main/charts/midaz/values.yaml`
   - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/helm/main/charts/reporter/values.yaml`
   - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/helm/main/charts/plugin-access-manager/values.yaml`

**Fallback:** If plugin/service not found, use Midaz core setup as baseline.

---

## Step 5: Ask Per-Component Sharing Model (CRITICAL)

<critical-warning>
⛔ **HARD GATE: MUST ASK ABOUT ALL DATABASE COMPONENTS**

This step requires asking about **BOTH** database types in a SINGLE question:
- **PostgreSQL** (RDS) - Relational database
- **DocumentDB** (MongoDB) - Document database

**FORBIDDEN:** Asking only about PostgreSQL and forgetting DocumentDB.
**REQUIRED:** Use the multiSelect AskUserQuestion with ALL components listed.
</critical-warning>

> **Reference:** See [infrastructure-cost-estimation-guide.md](../../docs/infrastructure-cost-estimation-guide.md#component-sharing-model-critical-input) for:
> - Sharing model definitions (SHARED vs DEDICATED vs ALWAYS SHARED)
> - How sharing works in practice per component
> - NAT Gateway architecture (ALWAYS SHARED)

**Components That MUST Be Asked:**
1. VPC, 2. EKS Nodes, 3. **PostgreSQL**, 4. **DocumentDB**, 5. Valkey, 6. RabbitMQ

**Note:** NAT Gateway and ALB are ALWAYS SHARED (platform-level resources).

**MANDATORY: Use AskUserQuestion tool with multiSelect:**

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Which components need DEDICATED instances? (All others use schema-based sharing)"
  header: "Dedicated"
  multiSelect: true
  options:
    - label: "VPC"
      description: "Fully isolated network (separate VPC per customer)"
    - label: "PostgreSQL"
      description: "Fully isolated RDS instance (not schema-based)"
    - label: "DocumentDB"
      description: "Fully isolated DocumentDB cluster"
    - label: "Valkey"
      description: "Fully isolated ElastiCache cluster"
    - label: "RabbitMQ"
      description: "Fully isolated Amazon MQ broker"
    - label: "EKS Nodes"
      description: "Dedicated compute nodes (separate node group)"
```

**Step 5 Verification Checklist:**
```
[ ] Used multiSelect question (not individual questions per component)
[ ] PostgreSQL included in options
[ ] DocumentDB included in options
[ ] All 6 configurable components listed
[ ] User response captured for ALL components

If any checkbox is NO → STOP and fix before proceeding to Step 6.
```

---

## Step 6: Database Configuration (Production Only)

**For PRODUCTION environment, ask about database HA configuration:**

### Multi-AZ (High Availability)

| Option | Description | Cost Impact |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Multi-AZ = YES** | Automatic failover, standby in different AZ | 2x database cost |
| **Multi-AZ = NO** | No automatic failover | 1x database cost |

**Default:** Production = Multi-AZ YES, Homolog = Multi-AZ NO

### Read Replicas (Scale Reads)

| TPS Range | Recommended Replicas | Why |
|-----------|---------------------|-----|
| < 100 TPS | 0 replicas | Primary can handle load |
| 100-300 TPS | 1 replica | Offload read queries |
| > 300 TPS | 2 replicas | Distribute read load |

**Use AskUserQuestion for database HA:**
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "For PRODUCTION databases, what HA configuration?"
  header: "Database HA"
  multiSelect: false
  options:
    - label: "Multi-AZ + Read Replicas (Recommended)"
      description: "Full HA: automatic failover + read scaling"
    - label: "Multi-AZ only"
      description: "Automatic failover, no read replicas"
    - label: "Single-AZ (Not recommended)"
      description: "No HA - only for cost-sensitive scenarios"
```

**Note:** Homolog/Staging always uses Single-AZ, no read replicas (testing only).

---

## Step 6b: Backup Configuration (Per Environment)

**Backup policies differ significantly between Homolog and Production:**

### Backup Types

| Backup Type | Description | AWS Service |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **RDS Automated Backups** | Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) | Included in RDS |
| **RDS Snapshots** | Manual/scheduled full backups | RDS Snapshots |
| **S3 Application Backups** | Application data exports | S3 Standard |
| **DocumentDB Backups** | Continuous backup + snapshots | DocumentDB |

### Environment-Specific Defaults

| Environment | Backup Type | Retention | PITR | Cost |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|------|------|
| **Homolog** | Automated only | 1-7 days | No | Minimal |
| **Production** | Full (automated + snapshots) | 7-35 days | Yes | Higher |

### Backup Cost Components

| Component | Pricing | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **RDS Automated Backup** | Free up to DB size | Beyond DB size: R$ 0.10/GB/month |
| **RDS Snapshots** | R$ 0.10/GB/month | Per snapshot retained |
| **S3 Standard** | R$ 0.12/GB/month | Application backups |
| **S3 Glacier** | R$ 0.02/GB/month | Archive (30+ days) |
| **DocumentDB Backup** | R$ 0.10/GB/month | Beyond retention period |

### Backup Sizing by TPS

| TPS | DB Storage | Homolog Backup | Production Backup | S3 App Backup |
|-----|------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **1-50** | 50GB | ~0 (free tier) | ~50GB × 2 snapshots | 25GB |
| **50-200** | 150GB | ~0 (free tier) | ~150GB × 3 snapshots | 75GB |
| **200-500** | 500GB | ~50GB (excess) | ~500GB × 4 snapshots | 250GB |

### Backup Configuration Questions

**Use AskUserQuestion for backup policy:**
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What backup retention policy for PRODUCTION?"
  header: "Backup Policy"
  multiSelect: false
  options:
    - label: "Standard (7-day retention, daily snapshots) (Recommended)"
      description: "7-day PITR + 7 daily snapshots (moderate cost)"
    - label: "Extended (35-day retention, daily + weekly snapshots)"
      description: "35-day PITR + daily/weekly snapshots (higher cost)"
    - label: "Minimal (1-day retention, weekly snapshots)"
      description: "1-day PITR + weekly snapshots (lower cost, higher risk)"
```

**Homolog Backup Policy:**
- Always minimal (1-7 day retention)
- No additional snapshots needed (testing environment)
- Cost: Typically free (within RDS automated backup limit)

---

## Step 7: Gather Billing Model

| Input | Question | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Billing Unit** | "What is the billing unit?" | `transaction` |
| **Price per Unit** | "What price per unit?" | `R$ 0.10` |
| **Expected Volume** | "Expected monthly volume?" | `1,000,000` |

---

## Step 8: Dispatch Agent with Complete Data

**BEFORE dispatching, skill MUST read actual resource configs:**

### 8a. Read Current Values from LerianStudio/helm (Based on Selected Products)

```
# ALWAYS read (platform-level, shared)
Read: charts/plugin-access-manager/values.yaml → Extract: identity, auth resources

# Read based on product selection (Step 1)
If Midaz Core selected:
  Read: charts/midaz/values.yaml → Extract: onboarding, transaction, ledger, crm resources

If Reporter selected:
  Read: charts/reporter/values.yaml → Extract: manager, worker, frontend resources

# Also extract database configurations for selected products
```

### 8b. Dispatch Agent with Collected Data

**Only dispatch AFTER reading actual values for selected products:**

```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "ring:infrastructure-cost-estimator"
  model: "opus"
  prompt: |
    Calculate infrastructure costs and profitability.

    ALL DATA PROVIDED (do not ask questions):

    Products Selected:
    - Access Manager: ALWAYS INCLUDED (shared platform)
    - Midaz Core: YES
    - Reporter: YES

    Infrastructure:
    - App Repo: /workspace/midaz
    - Helm Charts Source: LerianStudio/helm (values read below)
    - TPS: 100
    - Total Customers on Platform: 5

    Environments to Calculate: [Homolog, Production]

    Actual Resource Configurations (READ from LerianStudio/helm for selected products):

    # Access Manager (ALWAYS - shared platform)
    [INSERT VALUES FROM charts/plugin-access-manager/values.yaml]

    # Midaz Core (selected)
    [INSERT VALUES FROM charts/midaz/values.yaml]

    # Reporter (selected)
    [INSERT VALUES FROM charts/reporter/values.yaml]

    Component Sharing Model:
    | Component | Sharing | Customers |
    |-----------|---------|-----------|
    | VPC | SHARED | 5 |
    | EKS Cluster | SHARED | 5 |
    | EKS Nodes | SHARED | 5 |
    | PostgreSQL | DEDICATED | 1 |
    | Valkey | SHARED | 5 |
    | DocumentDB | SHARED | 5 |
    | RabbitMQ | SHARED | 5 |
    | ALB | SHARED | 5 |
    | NAT Gateway | ALWAYS SHARED | ALL |

    Database Configuration (Production):
    - Multi-AZ: YES
    - Read Replicas: Based on TPS (see Step 5)

    Database Configuration (Homolog):
    - All databases: Single-AZ, No replicas (testing only)

    Billing Model:
    - Billing Unit: transaction
    - Price per Unit: R$ 0.10
    - Expected Volume: 1,000,000/month

    Calculate and return:
    1. Discovered Services (from Helm charts)
    2. Compute Resources (from actual configs - calculate EKS nodes needed)
    3. Service Component Dependencies (which services use which components + Access Manager as ALWAYS SHARED)
    4. HOMOLOG Environment Costs (Ohio, Single-AZ, 1 replica)
    5. PRODUCTION Environment Costs (São Paulo, Multi-AZ, 3 replicas)
    6. Environment Comparison Summary (side-by-side)
    7. Cost by Category (compute, database, cache, network, storage)
    8. Shared vs Dedicated Summary
    9. TPS Capacity Analysis
    10. Profitability Analysis (using combined homolog + production costs)
    11. Summary with recommendations
```

## Example Workflow

### User Request:
> "Estimate costs for Midaz with 100 TPS, 5 customers sharing, PostgreSQL dedicated"

### Step 1: Select Products
```
Products Selected:
- Access Manager: ALWAYS INCLUDED (shared)
- Midaz Core: YES
- Reporter: YES (full platform)
```

### Steps 2-7: Skill Gathers Data
```
Repo: /workspace/midaz
TPS: 100
Total Customers: 5
Environments: Both (Homolog + Production)

Component Sharing:
- EKS Cluster: SHARED (5)
- PostgreSQL: DEDICATED (1)  ← user specified
- Valkey: SHARED (5)
- DocumentDB: SHARED (5)
- RabbitMQ: SHARED (5)

Billing:
- Unit: transaction
- Price: R$ 0.10
- Volume: 1,000,000/month
```

### Step 8a: Skill Reads LerianStudio/helm (for selected products)
```
# ALWAYS read (platform-level)
Read: charts/plugin-access-manager/values.yaml
  → identity: 100m CPU, 128Mi memory, 1-3 replicas
  → auth: 500m CPU, 256Mi memory, 3-9 replicas

# Midaz Core (selected)
Read: charts/midaz/values.yaml
  → onboarding: 1500m CPU, 512Mi memory, 2-5 replicas
  → transaction: 2000m CPU, 512Mi memory, 3-9 replicas
  → ledger: 1500m CPU, 256Mi memory, 2-9 replicas

# Reporter (selected)
Read: charts/reporter/values.yaml
  → manager: 100m CPU, 256Mi memory
  → worker: 100m CPU, 128Mi memory
  → frontend: 100m CPU, 128Mi memory
```

### Step 8b: Skill Dispatches Agent
```
Agent receives: Products selected + actual Helm values + all collected data
```

### Agent Returns:
```
## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Shared Infrastructure | R$ 1,018/customer |
| Dedicated Infrastructure | R$ 1,490/customer |
| **Total Cost/Customer** | **R$ 2,508/month** |
| Monthly Revenue | R$ 100,000 |
| Gross Profit | R$ 97,492 |
| Gross Margin | 97.5% |
```

## Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Assume all components are shared" | Customer may have dedicated DB | **ASK for each component** |
| "Skip component questions" | Cost attribution will be wrong | **Must ask shared/dedicated** |
| "Agent can figure it out" | Agent calculates, skill orchestrates | **Skill collects all data** |
| "Just use total customers" | Some components may be dedicated | **Per-component model required** |
| "Asked about PostgreSQL, that covers databases" | **PostgreSQL ≠ DocumentDB** - they are separate components with different costs | **MUST ask about BOTH PostgreSQL AND DocumentDB** |
| "DocumentDB is obviously shared/dedicated like PostgreSQL" | Customer may want different isolation levels for different data types | **Ask about each database separately in multiSelect** |
| "I'll ask about databases separately" | Separate questions risk forgetting one | **Use single multiSelect with ALL components** |
