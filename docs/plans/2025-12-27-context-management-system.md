# Context Management System - Macro Architecture Plan

> **For Agents:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Integrate 6 interconnected features from Continuous-Claude-v2 into Ring's `default/` plugin to create a self-improving, context-aware agent system.

**Architecture:** A unified context management system that persists session state across `/clear` operations, indexes all execution artifacts for semantic search, monitors context usage with proactive warnings, tracks outcome success/failure for learning, and compounds learnings into permanent rules that improve agent behavior over time.

**Tech Stack:**
- Python 3.8+ (artifact indexing, querying, learning extraction)
- SQLite3 with FTS5 (full-text search)
- Bash shell scripts (hook wrappers)
- JSON (hook configuration, state files)

**Global Prerequisites:**
- Environment: macOS/Linux, Python 3.8+
- Tools: `python3 --version` (3.8+), `sqlite3 --version` (3.x)
- Access: Write access to `default/` plugin directory
- State: On `main` branch, clean working tree

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This system enables Ring users to:

| Capability | User Benefit |
|------------|--------------|
| **Session Continuity** | Never lose work context when running `/clear` - ledger auto-saves and auto-restores |
| **Semantic Search** | Find relevant past work by meaning ("authentication issues") not just keywords |
| **Context Awareness** | Get proactive warnings at 50%/70%/85% context usage before hitting limits |
| **Outcome Tracking** | Know which approaches succeeded vs failed historically |
| **Self-Improvement** | System learns from successes/failures and creates permanent rules automatically |
| **RAG-Enhanced Planning** | New plans reference historical precedent for better decisions |

**Key Insight:** These 6 features form a **compounding loop** - outcomes feed learnings, learnings become rules, rules improve outcomes, better outcomes generate richer learnings.

### 3.1 Artifact Index Database

**Used by:** Handoff Tracking, Outcome Tracking, RAG Plan Judging, Compound Learnings

**Location:** `default/lib/artifact-index/`

**Components:**
- `artifact_schema.sql` - Database schema (handoffs, plans, continuity, queries tables with FTS5)
- `artifact_index.py` - Indexing script (parse markdown, insert into SQLite)
- `artifact_query.py` - Query script (FTS5 search, BM25 ranking)

## 6. Hook Integration Map

**How each feature connects to Ring's hook system:**

### 6.1 SessionStart Hooks

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `session-start.sh` (UPDATE) | `startup\|resume\|compact\|clear` | Load ledger, inject critical rules |

**Changes to existing `session-start.sh`:**
- Add ledger detection: `ls .ring/ledgers/CONTINUITY-*.md`
- Auto-load active ledger content into `additionalContext`
- Inject context usage status

### 6.2 UserPromptSubmit Hooks

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `context-usage-check.sh` (NEW) | `*` (all prompts) | Monitor context %, inject warnings |

**Warning Tiers:**
- 50%: Informational ("Context at 50%, consider summarizing soon")
- 70%: Warning ("Context at 70%, recommend /clear with ledger")
- 85%: Critical ("Context at 85%, MUST clear soon or risk losing work")

### 6.3 PostToolUse Hooks

| Hook | Matcher | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `artifact-index-write.sh` (NEW) | `Write` | Index handoffs/plans on creation |

**Behavior:**
- Detect if written file is in `handoffs/` or `plans/` directory
- Run `artifact_index.py --file <path>` for immediate indexing
- Fast path: Single file index takes <100ms

### 6.4 PreCompact Hooks

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `ledger-save.sh` (NEW) | PreCompact | Auto-save ledger before compaction |

**Behavior:**
- Check if active ledger exists
- Update ledger with current state
- Warn user: "Ledger saved. After compact, state will auto-restore."

### 6.5 Stop/SessionEnd Hooks

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `ledger-save.sh` (NEW) | Stop | Save ledger when agent stops |
| `session-outcome.sh` (NEW) | SessionEnd | Prompt for outcome, extract learnings |

**Outcome Flow:**
1. Agent stops
2. User prompted: "How did this session go?" (SUCCEEDED/PARTIAL_PLUS/PARTIAL_MINUS/FAILED)
3. Outcome saved to most recent handoff
4. Learnings extracted to `.ring/cache/learnings/`

---

## 7. Data Flow

### 7.1 Session Lifecycle

```
1. Session Start
   SessionStart hook fires
   ├── Check for active ledger in .ring/ledgers/
   ├── If found: Load into additionalContext
   └── Inject: Context usage status, critical rules

2. User Works
   UserPromptSubmit hook fires (every prompt)
   ├── Estimate context usage from session state
   ├── If >50%: Inject appropriate warning
   └── Continue processing

3. Artifacts Created
   PostToolUse(Write) hook fires
   ├── Check if file is handoff/plan
   ├── If yes: Run artifact_index.py --file <path>
   └── Artifact now searchable

4. Context Pressure
   User runs /clear OR PreCompact triggers
   ├── ledger-save.sh saves current state
   └── User informed: "State preserved in ledger"

5. Session Ends
   SessionEnd hook fires
   ├── Prompt for outcome (SUCCEEDED/PARTIAL/FAILED)
   ├── Mark outcome on latest handoff
   └── Extract learnings to cache
```

### 7.2 RAG-Enhanced Planning Flow

```
1. User requests new plan
   ├── Agent recognizes planning task
   └── Invokes artifact_query.py

2. Query artifacts
   ├── Search handoffs: "similar past implementations"
   ├── Search plans: "similar design approaches"
   └── Return: Top 5 relevant results with outcomes

3. Plan creation informed
   ├── Agent sees: "Authentication: SUCCEEDED (3x), FAILED (1x)"
   ├── Agent sees: What worked / What failed from past attempts
   └── New plan avoids past failures, reuses successes

4. Plan executed
   ├── Outcomes tracked
   └── Cycle continues (compounding)
```

### 7.3 Compound Learning Flow

```
1. Trigger
   ├── User runs /compound-learnings
   └── OR: Automatic on session end (if learnings exist)

2. Gather learnings
   ├── Read .ring/cache/learnings/*.md
   └── Aggregate patterns across sessions

3. Pattern detection
   ├── Frequency analysis: Which patterns appear 3+ times?
   ├── Consolidate similar patterns
   └── Categorize: Rule vs Skill vs Hook

4. Proposal
   ├── Present draft rules/skills to user
   └── Get approval

5. Creation
   ├── Write approved rules to .claude/rules/
   ├── Write approved skills to default/skills/
   └── System permanently improved
```

## 10. Success Criteria

### 10.1 Feature Acceptance Criteria

| Feature | Success Criteria |
|---------|------------------|
| Continuity Ledger | User runs `/clear`, ledger auto-saves, new session auto-loads state |
| Artifact Index | `artifact_query.py "auth"` returns relevant handoffs within 100ms |
| Context Warnings | Warning appears at 50%, 70%, 85% thresholds accurately |
| Handoff Tracking | New handoff automatically indexed, searchable immediately |
| Outcome Tracking | SessionEnd prompts for outcome, marks in database |
| RAG Planning | `write-plan` agent includes historical context in output |
| Compound Learnings | Pattern appearing 3+ times generates rule proposal |

### 10.2 Integration Acceptance Criteria

| Test | Expected Result |
|------|-----------------|
| Full session lifecycle | Start -> Work -> Clear -> Resume -> End with outcome |
| Cross-session search | Query finds handoffs from previous sessions |
| Learning loop | Failed approach in session 1 -> Rule created -> Avoided in session 2 |

---

## 11. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Hook performance overhead | Medium | High | Fast-path single file indexing, async where possible |
| SQLite concurrency issues | Low | Medium | Use WAL mode, single writer pattern |
| Context estimation inaccuracy | Medium | Low | Conservative estimates, err toward earlier warnings |
| User adoption | Medium | Medium | Gradual rollout, clear documentation, sensible defaults |

## Next Steps

1. **Approve this macro plan** - Review architecture decisions
2. **Run `/write-plan` for Phase 0** - Generate detailed plan for shared infrastructure
3. **Iterate through phases** - Each phase generates its own detailed plan
4. **Code review at each phase** - Ensure quality gates before proceeding
