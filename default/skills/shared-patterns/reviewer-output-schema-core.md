## Output Template

```markdown
# {Domain} Review ({Type})

## VERDICT: [PASS | FAIL | NEEDS_DISCUSSION]

## Summary
[2-3 sentences about overall findings in this domain]

```

---

## High Issues

[Same format as Critical]

## Medium Issues

[Same format, but can be more concise]

---

## Low Issues

---

## Next Steps

**If PASS:**

- Findings will be aggregated with other reviewers
- Ready for next stage

**If FAIL:**
- Critical/High/Medium issues must be fixed
- Low issues: track with TODO(review) comments

```

## Issue Format Requirements

Every issue MUST include:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Title** | YES | Clear, descriptive issue name |
| **Location** | YES | `file:line` reference (NEVER vague) |
| **Category** | YES | Domain-specific category |
| **Problem** | YES | What's wrong |
| **Impact** | YES | Why it matters |
| **Example** | For Critical/High | Current problematic code |
| **Recommendation** | For Critical/High | How to fix with code example |

---

## Verdict Rules

| Verdict | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| **PASS** | 0 Critical AND < 3 High issues |
| **FAIL** | 1+ Critical OR 3+ High issues |
| **NEEDS_DISCUSSION** | Cannot determine correctness without clarification |

**HARD GATE:** You CANNOT mark PASS if there are Critical issues or 3+ High issues.

---

## Domain-Specific Additional Sections

Each reviewer adds domain-specific sections AFTER the core sections:

| Reviewer | Additional Required Sections |
|----------|------------------------------|
| **ring:code-reviewer** | (core sections only) |
| **ring:business-logic-reviewer** | Mental Execution Analysis, Business Requirements Coverage, Edge Cases Analysis |
| **ring:security-reviewer** | OWASP Top 10 Coverage, Compliance Status |
| **ring:test-reviewer** | Test Coverage Analysis, Edge Cases Not Tested, Test Anti-Patterns |
| **ring:nil-safety-reviewer** | Nil Risk Trace, High-Risk Patterns, Recommended Guards |

---

## Parsing Requirements

**CRITICAL:** Orchestration systems parse reviewer output. Wrong format breaks automation.

- Use exact section headers as shown
- Use exact verdict format: `## VERDICT: PASS` (not `VERDICT: **PASS**` or variations)
- Include all required sections even if empty (e.g., "No critical issues found")
- Maintain consistent markdown structure
