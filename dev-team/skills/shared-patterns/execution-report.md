# Execution Report Format

This file defines the standard execution report format for all development cycle gates.

## Standard Report Structure

Every gate skill MUST produce an execution report with these base metrics:

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Duration | Xm Ys | Time spent executing the gate |
| Iterations | N | Number of retry attempts |
| Result | PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL | Gate outcome |

## How to Use This File

Skills should reference this format and add gate-specific metrics:

```markdown
## Execution Report

Base metrics per [shared-patterns/execution-report.md](../shared-patterns/execution-report.md):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | Xm Ys |
| Iterations | N |
| Result | PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL |
