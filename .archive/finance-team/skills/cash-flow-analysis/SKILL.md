| Element | Documentation |
|---------|---------------|
| Risk description | Clear statement |

| Impact | Quantified if possible |
| Mitigation | Specific action |

## Pressure Resistance

See [shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md](../shared-patterns/pressure-resistance.md) for universal pressures.

### Cash Flow-Specific Pressures

| Pressure Type | Request | Agent Response |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| "Use yesterday's balance" | "Treasury needs current data. I'll get today's position." |
| "Skip the forecast, just need position" | "Position without forecast lacks context. I'll include projections." |
| "Estimate the AR collections" | "Collections forecast needs AR aging basis. I'll use actual data." |
| "We never have liquidity issues" | "Past performance ≠ future results. I'll assess current risk." |

---

## Anti-Rationalization Table

See [shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations.

### Cash Flow-Specific Anti-Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Cash is cash, simple analysis" | Cash has many components | **ANALYZE by category** |
| "Forecast is same as last month" | Each forecast is independent | **BUILD fresh forecast** |
| "We always collect in 45 days" | Actual may differ | **USE actual aging** |
| "Covenant is not close" | Still needs monitoring | **CALCULATE covenant** |

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | Xm Ys |
| Accounts Reconciled | N |
| Forecast Periods | N |
