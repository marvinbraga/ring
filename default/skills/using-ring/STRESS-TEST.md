# ORCHESTRATOR Hardening Stress Test

This document contains stress test scenarios to verify the hardened ORCHESTRATOR enforcement catches all violation patterns.

## Test Methodology

For each scenario:
1. **Scenario**: Simulated user request
2. **Old Behavior**: What I would have done before hardening (violation)
3. **Enforcement Gates**: Which hardening mechanisms catch this violation
4. **Required Behavior**: What I must do now
5. **Verification**: Checklist items that must be completed

---

## Scenario 1: "Quick Grep" Rationalization

**User Request:**
> "Where is the authentication middleware used in the codebase?"

**Old Behavior (VIOLATION):**
```
My thought: "I'll quickly grep for 'authMiddleware' to see where it's imported"
Action: Grep tool with pattern "authMiddleware"
Result: 30k tokens of context bloat
```

**Enforcement Gates That Catch This:**
- ✅ **MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL** (line 34-38)
  - Step 2 requires: "Create TodoWrite: 'Orchestration decision: [agent-name] with Opus'"
  - Violation: No todo created before using Grep
- ✅ **MANDATORY PRE-TOOL-USE PROTOCOL** (line 132-146)
  - Checklist required before Grep
  - Must document: "Investigation task → MUST use agent"
- ✅ **Common Violation Patterns** (line 296-300)
  - Pattern 2: "I'll quickly check Y" explicitly listed
  - Shows correct alternative: Task tool with Explore agent

**Required Behavior:**
```
My thought: "This is an investigation task - orchestration decision required"

TodoWrite:
1. "Orchestration decision: Explore agent with Opus for auth middleware usage"

Pre-Tool-Use Check:
Tool I'm about to use: None (using agent)
Purpose: Find all uses of authentication middleware
Orchestration Decision: Investigation → Explore agent
Agent: Explore
Model: Opus

Action: Task tool with Explore agent, model=opus
```

**Verification Checklist:**
- ☐ TodoWrite created with "Orchestration decision: Explore agent with Opus"
- ☐ Pre-tool-use protocol documented (even if mental)
- ☐ No direct Grep call
- ☐ Opus model specified in Task call

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Multiple enforcement gates prevent violation

---

## Scenario 2: "User Mentioned File" Rationalization

**User Request:**
> "The bug seems to be in the config.ts file, can you help?"

**Old Behavior (VIOLATION):**
```
My thought: "User mentioned config.ts, let me read it"
Action: Read tool on src/config.ts
Result: Assumption wrong - bug actually in config loader, not config file
```

**Enforcement Gates That Catch This:**
- ✅ **MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL** (line 34-38)
  - Must create orchestration todo BEFORE reading
- ✅ **Your Role: ORCHESTRATOR** (line 196)
  - Exception requires: "User explicitly provides file path AND explicitly requests you read it"
  - "The bug seems to be in config.ts" ≠ "read config.ts"
- ✅ **Common Violation Patterns** (line 302-307)
  - Pattern 3 explicitly covers: "User mentioned Z"
  - Shows this STILL requires agent dispatch

**Required Behavior:**
```
My thought: "User mentioned config.ts but didn't explicitly ask me to read it - this is investigation"

TodoWrite:
1. "Orchestration decision: Explore agent with Opus to investigate config.ts and related configuration"

Action: Task tool with Explore agent, model=opus
Prompt: "Investigate bug related to config.ts - examine config.ts and configuration loading system"
```

**Verification Checklist:**
- ☐ TodoWrite created
- ☐ Recognized "mentioned" ≠ "read this specific file"
- ☐ Dispatched Explore agent instead of direct Read
- ☐ Opus model specified

**Result:** ✅ PASS - "User mentioned Z" pattern caught by Common Violation Patterns

---

## Scenario 3: "Need Context First" Rationalization

**User Request:**
> "Add a new API endpoint for user profile updates"

**Old Behavior (VIOLATION):**
```
My thought: "I need to understand the existing API structure first"
Action: Read routes/api.ts, Read controllers/user.ts, Read middleware/auth.ts
Result: 50k tokens of context before even starting task
```

**Enforcement Gates That Catch This:**
- ✅ **MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL** (line 34-38)
  - Must create orchestration todo FIRST
- ✅ **Common Violation Patterns** (line 309-314)
  - Pattern 4: "I need context to give the agent good instructions"
  - Explicitly states: "Agent BUILDS context for you"
- ✅ **Your Role: ORCHESTRATOR** (line 198-200)
  - ❌ "I need to understand the codebase structure first" → Explore agent

**Required Behavior:**
```
My thought: "This is new feature implementation - need to understand existing patterns first"

TodoWrite:
1. "Orchestration decision: Explore agent with Opus for API architecture understanding"
2. "Check for relevant skills" (might match brainstorming or pre-dev)

Action: Task tool with Explore agent, model=opus
Prompt: "Understand existing API endpoint patterns, user controller structure, and authentication middleware to inform new profile update endpoint"
```

**Verification Checklist:**
- ☐ TodoWrite created BEFORE any file reading
- ☐ Recognized "need context" as orchestration task
- ☐ Agent will build context, not me
- ☐ Opus model specified

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Pattern 4 explicitly addresses this rationalization

---

## Scenario 4: "Already Started" Sunk Cost

**User Request:**
> "How does error handling work in this codebase?"

**Old Behavior (VIOLATION):**
```
My thought: "Let me check the error utilities"
Action: Read utils/errors.ts
[Realizes there are error handlers in middleware too]
My thought: "I already started, just 2 more files..."
Action: Read middleware/errorHandler.ts, Read services/logger.ts
Result: 40k tokens, incomplete picture anyway
```

**Enforcement Gates That Catch This:**
- ✅ **MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL** (line 34-38)
  - Should have created orchestration todo BEFORE first read
- ✅ **Common Violation Patterns** (line 316-320)
  - Pattern 5: "I already started, might as well finish"
  - Shows correct action: STOP and dispatch agent with context learned
- ✅ **Anti-Patterns** (line 275-278)
  - "I already started reading files" → WRONG. Stop, dispatch agent instead
  - "I'm 90% done, just one more file" → WRONG. Chain reaction trap

**Required Behavior:**
```
My thought: "I read one file already - STOP. This is sunk cost fallacy"

Action: STOP immediately

TodoWrite (correcting course):
1. "Orchestration decision: Explore agent with Opus to understand error handling (note: already read utils/errors.ts)"

Task tool with Explore agent, model=opus:
"Understand error handling architecture in codebase. I've already read utils/errors.ts which defines error classes. Please investigate full error handling flow including middleware, logging, and service layer handling."
```

**Verification Checklist:**
- ☐ Recognized sunk cost fallacy mid-task
- ☐ Stopped before reading more files
- ☐ Created corrective orchestration todo
- ☐ Provided context to agent about what was already read
- ☐ Opus model specified

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Pattern 5 + Anti-Patterns catch this with explicit "STOP" instruction

---

## Scenario 5: "Simple Lookup" Rationalization

**User Request:**
> "What's the return type of the validateUser function?"

**Old Behavior (VIOLATION):**
```
My thought: "This is a simple lookup, just grep for the function definition"
Action: Grep for "validateUser"
Result: Multiple matches, need to read files to disambiguate, context spiral
```

**Enforcement Gates That Catch This:**
- ✅ **MANDATORY PRE-TOOL-USE PROTOCOL** (line 132-146)
  - Before Grep: Must complete checklist
  - "Investigation/exploration/search → MUST use agent"
  - Lookup IS search
- ✅ **Anti-Patterns** (line 262)
  - "This is a targeted lookup, not exploration" → WRONG. All lookups are exploration
- ✅ **Your Role: ORCHESTRATOR** (line 198)
  - ❌ "I'll grep for the function definition" → Explore agent

**Required Behavior:**
```
My thought: "Looking up function signature = search operation"

TodoWrite:
1. "Orchestration decision: Explore agent with Opus for validateUser function signature"

Pre-Tool-Use Check:
Tool I'm about to use: None (using agent)
Purpose: Find validateUser function return type
Orchestration Decision: Search operation → Explore agent
Agent: Explore
Model: Opus
```

**Verification Checklist:**
- ☐ Recognized "lookup" = "search" = orchestration task
- ☐ Did not rationalize as "too simple for agent"
- ☐ Completed pre-tool-use protocol
- ☐ Opus model specified

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Pre-tool-use protocol catches this before Grep executes

---

## Scenario 6: "User Explicitly Requested" - Valid Exception

**User Request:**
> "Read the file src/config/database.ts and tell me what the connection timeout is set to"

**Old Behavior (CORRECT):**
```
My thought: "User explicitly requested I read a specific file"
Action: Read src/config/database.ts
Result: Found timeout setting, reported back
```

**Enforcement Gates:**
- ✅ **Your Role: ORCHESTRATOR** (line 196)
  - Exception: "User explicitly provides file path AND explicitly requests you read it"
  - ✅ Has file path: src/config/database.ts
  - ✅ Explicit request: "Read the file"

**Required Behavior:**
```
TodoWrite:
1. "Orchestration decision: Direct read of src/config/database.ts (user explicitly requested)"

Pre-Tool-Use Check:
Tool I'm about to use: Read
Purpose: Find connection timeout setting
Orchestration Decision: Explicit user request for specific file → Direct tool OK
Exception justification: User said "Read the file src/config/database.ts"

Action: Read src/config/database.ts
```

**Verification Checklist:**
- ☐ TodoWrite created with explicit exception justification
- ☐ Pre-tool-use protocol documented exception
- ☐ Exception criteria met: explicit file path + explicit read request
- ☐ Direct Read is acceptable

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Valid exception properly documented

---

## Scenario 7: Model Selection Violation

**User Request:**
> "Explore the authentication system architecture"

**Old Behavior (VIOLATION):**
```
My thought: "I'll use Explore agent"
Action: Task tool with Explore agent (defaults to Haiku)
Result: Works but violates Opus default requirement
```

**Enforcement Gates That Catch This:**
- ✅ **MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL** (line 35-36)
  - TodoWrite must include: "[agent-name] with Opus"
  - Default model: Opus (unless user specifies)
- ✅ **Your Role: ORCHESTRATOR** (line 194)
  - "Model Selection: Always use Opus...unless user explicitly specifies otherwise"
- ✅ **TodoWrite Examples** (line 373-382)
  - ✅ Correct: "Explore agent with Opus"
  - ❌ Wrong: "Orchestration decision: Explore agent" (missing model)

**Required Behavior:**
```
TodoWrite:
1. "Orchestration decision: Explore agent with Opus for authentication architecture"

Action: Task tool with Explore agent
```

**Verification Checklist:**
- ☐ TodoWrite includes "with Opus"
- ☐ Task tool call uses appropriate agent
- ☐ Did not default to Haiku
- ☐ No user specification of different model

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Model requirement enforced in protocol, examples, and TodoWrite format

---

## Scenario 8: User Specifies Different Model - Valid Override

**User Request:**
> "Use Haiku to quickly find where the logger is configured"

**Old Behavior (N/A - new requirement):**

**Required Behavior:**
```
My thought: "User explicitly specified Haiku - override Opus default"

TodoWrite:
1. "Orchestration decision: Explore agent with Haiku (user specified) for logger configuration"

Action: Task tool with Explore agent, model="haiku"
```

**Verification Checklist:**
- ☐ Recognized explicit user model specification
- ☐ TodoWrite documents "user specified"
- ☐ Used Haiku instead of Opus (valid override)

**Result:** ✅ PASS - User override respected

## Enforcement Coverage Matrix

| Violation Pattern | MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE | PRE-TOOL-USE PROTOCOL | ORCHESTRATOR (No Exceptions) | Common Violation Patterns | TodoWrite Requirement | Anti-Patterns |
|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Quick grep | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| User mentioned file | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | - |
| Need context first | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Already started | ✅ | ✅ | - | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Simple lookup | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | - | ✅ | ✅ |
| Missing Opus model | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | - | ✅ | - |

**Average Enforcement Gates Per Violation: 4.8**

Every violation pattern is caught by **at least 4 different enforcement mechanisms**, creating redundant protection against ORCHESTRATOR breakage.

---

## Critical Success Factors

### ✅ What Makes This Hardening Effective:

1. **Front-Loaded Decision** - Orchestration happens in step 2 of MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL (before skill check, before tool use)

2. **Triple Enforcement** - Every violation is caught by:
   - MANDATORY protocol (TodoWrite requirement)
   - PRE-TOOL-USE protocol (checklist before tools)
   - Pattern recognition (Common Violation Patterns)

3. **Audit Trail** - TodoWrite makes orchestration decision visible to user, creating accountability

4. **Single Exception** - Eliminated 4-condition exception, leaving only: "user explicitly says read [file]"

5. **Real Pattern Examples** - Common Violation Patterns shows my actual thoughts vs correct actions

6. **Opus Default** - Model specification enforced at protocol level, examples, and TodoWrite format

### ❌ What Would Make It Fail:

1. If I don't read the MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL
2. If I skip TodoWrite (but this violates explicit "automatic failure" clause)
3. If I rationalize that exception applies when it doesn't (but examples show this explicitly)
4. If I forget Opus model (but TodoWrite examples show required format)

**Hardening Assessment: ROBUST** - Multiple redundant enforcement gates make violation nearly impossible without explicit conscious choice to disobey.

---

## Stress Test Result: ✅ PASS

**All 8 scenarios demonstrate that the hardened skill would catch violations through multiple enforcement mechanisms.**

**Key Improvements from Hardening:**
- Orchestration decision moved to step 2 of first response (before everything else)
- Pre-tool-use protocol creates hard stop before Read/Grep/Glob/Bash
- Common Violation Patterns provides real-time pattern recognition
- TodoWrite requirement creates audit trail and user visibility
- Opus model requirement ensures consistent high-quality agent dispatch
- Exception clause reduced to single clear rule (no rationalization path)

**Recommendation: Deploy hardening to production.** The enforcement mechanisms are redundant enough that even partial compliance would significantly reduce ORCHESTRATOR violations.
