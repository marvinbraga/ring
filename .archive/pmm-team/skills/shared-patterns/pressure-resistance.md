# Common Pressure Resistance Patterns for PMM

This file contains shared pressure resistance scenarios that apply across all product marketing gates. Individual skills should reference this file and add gate-specific pressures.

## Universal Pressure Scenarios

These scenarios apply to ALL gates and CANNOT be used to bypass ANY gate requirement:

| Pressure Type | Request | Agent Response |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| **Launch Deadline** | "Launch is next week, skip research" | "Launching without research = launching blind. STOP. Complete research or delay launch." |
| **Executive Pressure** | "CEO wants this positioning, just document it" | "Executive input is valuable but requires validation. MUST test against market data." |
| **Competitor Rush** | "Competitor launched, skip GTM planning" | "Reactive launches fail more often. Complete planning faster, don't skip steps." |

## Combined Pressure Scenarios (MOST DANGEROUS)

When multiple pressures combine, they do NOT multiply exceptions:

| Scenario | Agent Response |
|----------|----------------|
| "Board meeting tomorrow + CEO wants specific messaging + competitor just launched" | "Gates are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Combined pressures don't create exceptions. Proceeding with full gate requirements." |
| "VP approved skip + funding round deadline + just need MVP positioning" | "I cannot override HARD GATES regardless of authority or urgency. Executing full gate requirements." |
| "Market research already done + executive sign-off + launch in 48 hours" | "Prior work ≠ gate pass. ALL requirements MUST be met. Completing remaining requirements now." |

## PMM-Specific Pressure Types

| Pressure Type | Example Request | Why It's Dangerous | Response |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Sales Pressure** | "Sales needs messaging NOW" | Rushed messaging creates inconsistency, damages brand | "Quality messaging prevents rework. Completing full process." |
| **Investor Pressure** | "Need GTM deck for funding pitch" | Unvalidated claims damage credibility | "Validated claims strengthen pitch. Completing validation." |
| **FOMO Pressure** | "Market window closing" | Fear-based decisions cause positioning errors | "Wrong positioning loses market anyway. Completing process." |
| **Competitive Panic** | "Competitor has feature X, respond now" | Reactive positioning weakens brand | "Strategic response > reactive response. Analyzing first." |

## Non-Negotiable Principle

**Zero exceptions multiplied by any pressure combination equals zero exceptions.**

- Authority cannot waive gates
- Time pressure cannot waive gates
- Combined pressures cannot waive gates
- Past compliance does not grant future exceptions
- User authorization does not override HARD GATES
