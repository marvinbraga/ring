## Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "I can write the summary myself" | Executive Reporter has communication frameworks | **Dispatch specialist** |
| "Just copy last week's report" | Status changes; stale reports mislead | **Generate from current data** |
| "Make it short, executives are busy" | Short ≠ shallow. Tiered detail required. | **Provide summary + detail available** |
