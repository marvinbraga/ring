# 💍 The Ring - Skills Library for AI Agents

**Proven engineering practices, enforced through skills.**

Ring is a comprehensive skills library and workflow system for AI agents that transforms how AI assistants approach software development. Currently implemented as a **Claude Code plugin marketplace** with **5 active plugins**, the skills themselves are agent-agnostic and can be used with any AI agent system. Ring provides battle-tested patterns, mandatory workflows, and systematic approaches to common development tasks.

## ✨ Why Ring?

Without Ring, AI assistants often:
- Skip tests and jump straight to implementation
- Make changes without understanding root causes
- Claim tasks are complete without verification
- Forget to check for existing solutions
- Repeat known mistakes

Ring solves this by:
- **Enforcing proven workflows** - Test-driven development, systematic debugging, proper planning
- **Providing 38 specialized skills** - From brainstorming to production deployment (20 core + 2 dev-team + 9 product planning + 6 FinOps + 1 ralph-wiggum)
- **17 specialized agents** - 5 review/planning agents + 10 developer role agents + 2 FinOps agents
- **Automating skill discovery** - Skills load automatically at session start
- **Preventing common failures** - Built-in anti-patterns and mandatory checklists

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Features (New!)

Ring now includes powerful infrastructure tools for automation and validation:

### Automated Code Review

**Parallel 3-gate review for 3x faster feedback:**
```bash
/ring:review src/auth.ts
```

Runs all 3 reviewers simultaneously (Code, Business, Security) - aggregates findings by severity:
- **Critical/High/Medium** → Fix immediately, re-run all 3
- **Low** → Add `TODO(review)` comments in code
- **Cosmetic** → Add `FIXME(nitpick)` comments in code

### Skill Discovery

**Find the right skill for your task:**
```bash
/ring:which-skill "debug authentication error"
# Returns: systematic-debugging (HIGH confidence)
```

### Compliance Validation

**Verify you're following skill workflows:**
```bash
/ring:validate test-driven-development
# Checks: Test file exists, test fails first, etc.
```

### Usage Metrics

**Track skill effectiveness:**
```bash
/ring:metrics test-driven-development
# Shows: usage count, compliance rate, common violations
```

### Workflow Guidance

**Get next skill suggestion:**
```bash
/ring:next-skill test-driven-development "test revealed bug"
# Suggests: systematic-debugging
```

   # Install Python dependencies (optional, but recommended)
   cd ~/ring
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   **Note:** Python dependencies are optional. The hooks will use fallback parsers if PyYAML is unavailable.

### First Session

When you start a new Claude Code session with Ring installed, you'll see:

```
## Available Skills:
- using-ring (Check for skills BEFORE any task)
- test-driven-development (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle)
- systematic-debugging (4-phase root cause analysis)
- verification-before-completion (Evidence before claims)
... and 30 more skills
```

## 🎯 Core Skills

### The Big Four (Use These First!)

#### 1. **using-ring** - Mandatory Skill Discovery
```
Before ANY action → Check skills
Before ANY tool → Check skills
Before ANY code → Check skills
```

#### 2. **test-driven-development** - Test First, Always
```
RED → Write failing test → Watch it fail
GREEN → Minimal code → Watch it pass
REFACTOR → Clean up → Stay green
```

#### 3. **systematic-debugging** - Find Root Cause
```
Phase 1: Investigate (gather ALL evidence)
Phase 2: Analyze patterns
Phase 3: Test hypothesis (one at a time)
Phase 4: Implement fix (with test)
```

#### 4. **verification-before-completion** - Prove It Works
```
Run command → Paste output → Then claim
No "should work" → Only "does work" with proof
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Building a Feature
```
User: "Add user authentication to the app"
Claude: I'm using the brainstorming skill to design this feature...
        [Structured exploration of requirements]
Claude: I'm using test-driven-development to implement...
        [RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle for each component]
Claude: I'm using verification-before-completion to confirm...
        [Runs tests, shows actual output]
```

### Fixing a Bug
```
User: "The app crashes when clicking submit"
Claude: I'm using systematic-debugging to investigate...
        Phase 1: [Gathering evidence]
        Phase 2: [Pattern analysis]
        Phase 3: [Hypothesis testing]
        Phase 4: [Implementing fix with test]
```

### Planning a Project
```
User: "Plan an e-commerce platform"
Claude: I'll use the pre-dev workflow to plan this systematically...
        Gate 1: PRD Creation [Business requirements]
        Gate 2: Feature Map [Domain groupings]
        Gate 3: TRD Creation [Architecture patterns]
        ... [Through all 8 gates]
```

### Code Review (Parallel, 3x Faster!)
```
User: "Review my authentication implementation"
Claude: Dispatching all 3 reviewers in parallel...
        [Launches code-reviewer, business-logic-reviewer, security-reviewer simultaneously]

        Code reviewer: PASS. Clean architecture, good tests.
        Business reviewer: FAIL. Missing password reset flow (HIGH severity).
        Security reviewer: FAIL. JWT secret hardcoded (CRITICAL severity).

        Aggregating issues by severity:
        - CRITICAL: JWT secret hardcoded in auth.ts:42
        - HIGH: Password reset flow missing from requirements

        Dispatching fix subagent to address Critical/High issues...
        [Fixes applied]

        Re-running all 3 reviewers in parallel...
        All reviewers: PASS. Ready for production.
```

**Key benefits:**
- **3x faster** - All reviewers run simultaneously (not sequential)
- **Comprehensive** - Get all feedback at once, easier to prioritize
- **Tech debt tracking** - Low/Cosmetic issues tracked with TODO/FIXME comments in code
- **Model-specific** - All reviewers run on Opus for deep analysis

   ```

3. **Follow core plugin structure**
   - Use same layout as `default/`
   - Create `product-xyz/hooks/hooks.json` for initialization
   - Add skills to `product-xyz/skills/`

### Skill Quality Standards

- **Mandatory sections**: When to use, How to use, Anti-patterns
- **Include checklists**: TodoWrite-compatible task lists
- **Evidence-based**: Require verification before claims
- **Battle-tested**: Based on real-world experience
- **Clear triggers**: Unambiguous "when to use" conditions

## 📖 Documentation

- **Skills Quick Reference** - Auto-generated at session start from skill frontmatter
- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) - Repository guide for Claude Code
- [Design Documents](docs/plans/) - Implementation plans and architecture decisions

## 🎯 Philosophy

Ring embodies these principles:

1. **Skills are mandatory, not optional** - If a skill applies, it MUST be used
2. **Evidence over assumptions** - Prove it works, don't assume
3. **Process prevents problems** - Following workflows prevents known failures
4. **Small steps, verified often** - Incremental progress with continuous validation
5. **Learn from failure** - Anti-patterns document what doesn't work

## 📊 Success Metrics

Teams using Ring report:
- 90% reduction in "works on my machine" issues
- 75% fewer bugs reaching production
- 60% faster debugging cycles
- 100% of code covered by tests (enforced by TDD)

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Ring is built on decades of collective software engineering wisdom, incorporating patterns from:
- Extreme Programming (XP)
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Agile methodologies
- DevOps practices

Special thanks to the Lerian Team for battle-testing these skills in production.
