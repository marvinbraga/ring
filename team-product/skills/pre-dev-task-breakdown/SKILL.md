# Task Breakdown - Value-Driven Decomposition

## Foundational Principle

**Every task must deliver working software that provides measurable user value.**

Creating technical-only or oversized tasks creates:
- Work that doesn't ship until "everything is done"
- Teams working on pieces that don't integrate
- No early validation of value or technical approach
- Waterfall development disguised as iterative process

**Tasks answer**: What working increment will be delivered?
**Tasks never answer**: How to implement that increment (that's Subtasks).

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- PRD has passed Gate 1 validation (REQUIRED)
- TRD has passed Gate 3 validation (REQUIRED)
- Feature Map has passed Gate 2 validation (OPTIONAL - use if exists)
- API Design has passed Gate 4 validation (OPTIONAL - use if exists)
- Data Model has passed Gate 5 validation (OPTIONAL - use if exists)
- Dependency Map has passed Gate 6 validation (OPTIONAL - use if exists)
- About to break down work for sprints/iterations
- Tempted to create "Setup Infrastructure" as a task
- Asked to estimate or plan implementation work
- Before creating subtasks

## Mandatory Workflow

### Phase 1: Task Identification (Inputs Required)

**Required Inputs:**
1. **Approved PRD** (Gate 1 passed) - business requirements and priorities (REQUIRED - check `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/prd.md`)
2. **Approved TRD** (Gate 3 passed) - architecture patterns documented (REQUIRED - check `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/trd.md`)

**Optional Inputs (use if exists for richer context):**
3. **Approved Feature Map** (Gate 2 passed) - feature relationships mapped (check `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/feature-map.md`)
4. **Approved API Design** (Gate 4 passed) - contracts specified (check `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/api-design.md`)
5. **Approved Data Model** (Gate 5 passed) - data structures defined (check `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/data-model.md`)
6. **Approved Dependency Map** (Gate 6 passed) - tech stack locked (check `docs/pre-dev/<feature-name>/dependency-map.md`)

**Analysis:**
7. **Identify value streams** - what delivers user value first?

### Phase 2: Decomposition
For each TRD component or PRD feature:
1. **Define deliverable** - what working software ships?
2. **Set success criteria** - how do we know it's done?
3. **Map dependencies** - what must exist first?
4. **Estimate effort** - T-shirt size (S/M/L/XL, max is XL = 2 weeks)
5. **Plan testing** - how will we verify it works?
6. **Identify risks** - what could go wrong?

### Phase 3: Gate 7 Validation
**MANDATORY CHECKPOINT** - Must pass before proceeding to Subtasks:
- [ ] All TRD components covered by tasks
- [ ] Every task delivers working software
- [ ] Each task has measurable success criteria
- [ ] Dependencies are correctly mapped
- [ ] No task exceeds 2 weeks effort (XL max)
- [ ] Testing strategy defined for each task
- [ ] Risks identified with mitigations
- [ ] Delivery sequence optimizes value

## Explicit Rules

### ✅ DO Include in Tasks
- Task ID, title, type (Foundation/Feature/Integration/Polish)
- Deliverable: What working software ships?
- User value: What can users do after this?
- Technical value: What does this enable?
- Success criteria (testable, measurable)
- Dependencies (blocks/requires/optional)
- Effort estimate (S/M/L/XL with points)
- Testing strategy (unit/integration/e2e)
- Risk identification with mitigations
- Definition of Done checklist

### ❌ NEVER Include in Tasks
- Implementation details (file paths, code examples)
- Step-by-step instructions (those go in subtasks)
- Technical-only tasks with no user value
- Tasks exceeding 2 weeks effort (break them down)
- Vague success criteria ("improve performance")
- Missing dependency information
- Undefined testing approach

### Task Sizing Rules
1. **Small (S)**: 1-3 points, 1-3 days, single component
2. **Medium (M)**: 5-8 points, 3-5 days, few dependencies
3. **Large (L)**: 13 points, 1-2 weeks, multiple components
4. **XL (over 2 weeks)**: BREAK IT DOWN - too large to be atomic

### Value Delivery Rules
1. **Foundation tasks** enable other work (database setup, core services)
2. **Feature tasks** deliver user-facing capabilities
3. **Integration tasks** connect to external systems
4. **Polish tasks** optimize or enhance (nice-to-have)

## Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "This 3-week task is fine" | Tasks >2 weeks hide complexity. Break it down. |
| "Setup tasks don't need value" | Setup enables value. Define what it enables. |
| "Success criteria are obvious" | Obvious to you ≠ testable. Document explicitly. |
| "Dependencies will be clear later" | Later is too late. Map them now. |
| "We don't need detailed estimates" | Without estimates, no planning possible. Size them. |
| "Technical tasks can skip user value" | Even infrastructure enables users. Define the connection. |
| "Testing strategy can be decided during" | Testing affects design. Plan it upfront. |
| "Risks aren't relevant at task level" | Risks compound across tasks. Identify them early. |
| "DoD is the same for all tasks" | Different tasks need different criteria. Specify. |
| "We can combine multiple features" | Combining hides value delivery. Keep tasks focused. |

## Red Flags - STOP

If you catch yourself writing any of these in a task, **STOP**:

- Task estimates over 2 weeks
- Tasks named "Setup X" without defining what X enables
- Success criteria like "works" or "complete" (not measurable)
- No dependencies listed (every task depends on something)
- No testing strategy (how will you verify?)
- "Technical debt" as a task type (debt reduction must deliver value)
- Vague deliverables ("improve", "optimize", "refactor")
- Missing Definition of Done

**When you catch yourself**: Refine the task until it's concrete, valuable, and testable.

## Delivery Sequencing

Optimize task order for value:

```yaml
Sprint 1 - Foundation:
  Goal: Enable core workflows
  Tasks:
    - T-001: Database foundation (blocks all)
    - T-002: Auth foundation (start, high value)

Sprint 2 - Core Features:
  Goal: Ship minimum viable feature
  Tasks:
    - T-002: Auth foundation (complete)
    - T-005: User dashboard (depends on T-002)
    - T-010: Basic API endpoints (high value)

Sprint 3 - Enhancements:
  Goal: Polish and extend
  Tasks:
    - T-006: Password reset (medium value)
    - T-011: Advanced search (nice-to-have)
    - T-015: Performance optimization (polish)

Critical Path: T-001 → T-002 → T-005 → T-010
Parallel Work: After T-001, T-003 and T-004 can run parallel to T-002
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Technical Debt Tasks**: "Refactor authentication" (no user value)
❌ **Giant Tasks**: 3+ week efforts (break them down)
❌ **Vague Tasks**: "Improve performance" (not measurable)
❌ **Sequential Bottlenecks**: Everything depends on one task
❌ **Missing Value**: Tasks that don't ship working software

✅ **Good Task Names**:
- "Users can register and log in with email" (clear value)
- "API responds in <500ms for 95th percentile" (measurable)
- "Admin dashboard shows real-time metrics" (working software)

```

## Output Location

**Always output to**: `docs/pre-development/tasks/tasks-[feature-name].md`

## After Task Breakdown Approval

1. ✅ Tasks become sprint backlog
2. 🎯 Use tasks as input for atomic subtasks (next phase: `pre-dev-subtask-creation`)
3. 📊 Track progress per task (not per subtask)
4. 🚫 No implementation yet - that's in subtasks

## Quality Self-Check

Before declaring task breakdown complete, verify:
- [ ] Every task delivers working software (not just "progress")
- [ ] All tasks have measurable success criteria
- [ ] Dependencies are mapped (blocks/requires/optional)
- [ ] Effort estimates are realistic (S/M/L/XL, no >2 weeks)
- [ ] Testing strategy defined for each task
- [ ] Risks identified with mitigations
- [ ] Definition of Done is comprehensive for each
- [ ] Delivery sequence optimizes value (high-value tasks early)
- [ ] No technical-only tasks without user connection
- [ ] Gate 7 validation checklist 100% complete

## The Bottom Line

**If you created tasks that don't deliver working software, rewrite them.**

Tasks are not technical activities. Tasks are working increments.

"Setup database" is not a task. "User data persists correctly" is a task.
"Implement OAuth" is not a task. "Users can log in with Google" is a task.
"Write tests" is not a task. Tests are part of Definition of Done for other tasks.

Every task must answer: **"What working software can I demo to users?"**

If you can't demo it, it's not a task. It's subtask implementation detail.

**Deliver value. Ship working software. Make tasks demoable.**
