# Dev Review (Gate 4)

## Overview

Execute comprehensive code review using 3 specialized reviewers IN PARALLEL. Aggregate findings and determine VERDICT for gate passage.

**Core principle:** Three perspectives catch more bugs than one. Parallel execution = 3x faster feedback.

## Pressure Resistance

**Gate 4 (Review) requires ALL 3 reviewers in parallel. Pressure scenarios and required responses:**

| Pressure Type | Request | Agent Response |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| **One Reviewer** | "One reviewer is enough" | "3 reviewers catch different issues. Code=architecture, Business=logic, Security=vulnerabilities. All required." |
| **Cosmetic Only** | "Only cosmetic issues, skip fixes" | "Cosmetic issues affect maintainability. Fix or document with FIXME. No silent ignoring." |
| **Skip Re-review** | "Passed first time, skip re-review" | "After ANY fix, re-run ALL 3 reviewers. Fixes can introduce new issues." |
| **Time** | "Review takes too long" | "3 parallel reviewers = 10 min total. Sequential = 30 min. Parallel is faster." |

**Non-negotiable principle:** ALL 3 reviewers MUST run in a SINGLE message with 3 Task tool calls. Sequential = violation.

## Common Rationalizations - REJECTED

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Trivial change, skip review" | Security vulnerabilities fit in 1 line. ALL changes require ALL 3 reviewers. |
| "Only N lines changed" | Line count is irrelevant. SQL injection is 1 line. Review ALL changes. |
| "Code reviewer covers security" | Code reviewer checks architecture. Security reviewer checks OWASP. Different expertise. |
| "Only found LOW issues" | LOW issues accumulate into technical debt. Document in TODO or fix. |
| "Small fix, no re-review needed" | Small fixes can have big impacts. Re-run ALL reviewers after ANY change. |
| "One reviewer said PASS" | PASS requires ALL 3 reviewers. One PASS + one FAIL = overall FAIL. |
| "Business logic is tested" | Tests check behavior. Review checks intent, edge cases, requirements alignment. |
| "Security scan passed" | Security scanners miss logic flaws. Human reviewer required. |
| "CSS can't have security issues" | CSS can have XSS (user-controlled classes), clickjacking (z-index manipulation), data exfiltration (CSS injection). ALL code needs security review. |
| "Only MEDIUM issues, can proceed" | MEDIUM issues must be fixed OR documented with FIXME. No silent ignoring. |
| "Document MEDIUM and ship" | Documentation ≠ resolution. Fix now, or add FIXME with timeline. |
| "Risk-accept MEDIUM issues" | Risk acceptance requires explicit user approval, not agent decision. |
| "User said skip review" | User cannot override HARD GATES. Review is mandatory. Proceed with review. |
| "Manager approved without review" | Management approval ≠ technical review. Run all 3 reviewers. |
| "Emergency deployment" | Emergencies need review MORE. Run parallel review (10 min). |

## Red Flags - STOP

If you catch yourself thinking ANY of these, STOP immediately:

- "This change is too trivial for review"
- "Only N lines, skip review"
- "One reviewer found nothing, skip the others"
- "These are just cosmetic issues"
- "Small fix doesn't need re-review"
- "Sequential reviews are fine this time"
- "Security scanner covers security review"
- "Business tests cover business review"
- "CSS can't have security issues"
- "Only MEDIUM issues, not blocking"
- "Risk-accept these findings"

**All of these indicate Gate 4 violation. Run ALL 3 reviewers in parallel.**

## MEDIUM Severity Handling - Explicit Protocol

**MEDIUM issues are NOT automatically waived:**

| MEDIUM Issue Response | Allowed? | Action Required |
|----------------------|----------|-----------------|
| Fix immediately | ✅ YES | Fix, re-run reviewers |
| Add FIXME with issue link | ✅ YES | `// FIXME(review): [description] - Issue #123` |
| Ignore silently | ❌ NO | This is a violation |
| "Risk accept" without user | ❌ NO | User must explicitly approve |
| Document in commit msg only | ❌ NO | Must be in code as FIXME |

**If agent wants to proceed without fixing MEDIUM:**
1. STOP
2. Present MEDIUM issues to user
3. Ask: "Fix now or add FIXME with tracking?"
4. User must explicitly choose
5. Document choice in review summary

## Parallel Execution - MANDATORY

**You MUST dispatch all 3 reviewers in a SINGLE message:**

```
Task tool #1: ring-default:code-reviewer
Task tool #2: ring-default:business-logic-reviewer
Task tool #3: ring-default:security-reviewer
```

**VIOLATIONS:**
- ❌ Running reviewers one at a time
- ❌ Running 2 reviewers, skipping 1
- ❌ Running reviewers in separate messages
- ❌ Skipping re-review after fixes

**The ONLY acceptable pattern is 3 Task tools in 1 message.**

**If you already dispatched reviewers sequentially (separate messages):**
1. STOP immediately - this is a violation
2. Discard sequential results (they're incomplete context)
3. Re-dispatch ALL 3 reviewers in a SINGLE message with 3 Task tool calls
4. Sequential dispatch wastes time AND misses cross-domain insights

## Prerequisites

Before starting this gate:
- All tests pass (Gate 3 complete)
- Implementation is feature-complete
- Code is committed (or ready to diff)

## Reviewer Specializations

| Reviewer | Focus Area | Catches |
|----------|------------|---------|
| `ring-default:code-reviewer` | Architecture, patterns, maintainability | Design flaws, code smells, DRY violations |
| `ring-default:business-logic-reviewer` | Correctness, requirements, edge cases | Logic errors, missing cases, requirement gaps |
| `ring-default:security-reviewer` | OWASP, auth, input validation | Vulnerabilities, injection risks, auth bypasses |

## Step 1: Prepare Review Context

Gather: `BASE_SHA=$(git merge-base HEAD main)`, `HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`, `git diff --name-only $BASE_SHA $HEAD_SHA`

**Review context:** WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED, PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS, ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA (AC-1, AC-2...), BASE_SHA, HEAD_SHA, FILES_CHANGED

## Step 2: Dispatch All 3 Reviewers IN PARALLEL

**CRITICAL: Single message with 3 Task tool calls:**

| Task | Agent | Prompt |
|------|-------|--------|
| #1 | `ring-default:code-reviewer` | Review context (WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED, PLAN, ACs, SHAs) |
| #2 | `ring-default:business-logic-reviewer` | Same context |
| #3 | `ring-default:security-reviewer` | Same context |

**Wait for ALL three to complete before proceeding.**

## Step 3: Collect Individual Findings

Each reviewer returns: VERDICT (PASS/FAIL/NEEDS_DISCUSSION), Summary, Issues (by severity), What Was Done Well, Next Steps.

Extract per reviewer: VERDICT + Critical/High/Medium/Low issue lists.

## Step 4: Aggregate Findings

Combine all findings by severity with source attribution: Critical (block release), High (must fix), Medium (should fix), Low (track as TODO).

## Step 5: Determine VERDICT

| Condition | VERDICT | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| All 3 reviewers PASS, no Critical/High | **PASS** | Proceed to Gate 5 |
| Any Critical finding | **FAIL** | Return to Gate 0 |
| 2+ High findings | **FAIL** | Return to Gate 0 |
| 1 High finding | **NEEDS_DISCUSSION** | Evaluate with stakeholder |
| Only Medium/Low findings | **PASS** | Track issues, proceed |

## Step 6: Handle VERDICT

| VERDICT | Actions |
|---------|---------|
| **PASS** | Document → Add `// TODO(review):` for Low, `// FIXME(review):` for Medium → Proceed to Gate 5 |
| **FAIL** | Document Critical/High → Create fix tasks → Return to Gate 0 → Re-run ALL 3 reviewers after fixes |
| **NEEDS_DISCUSSION** | Present High finding to stakeholder with options: Fix now / Accept risk / Partial fix → Wait for decision |

## Step 7: Document Review Outcome

**Review Summary contents:** Task ID, Date, Reviewers (all 3), VERDICT, Individual Verdicts, Findings Summary (Critical/High/Medium/Low counts), Actions Taken, Next Steps.

## Re-Review Protocol

**After fixing Critical/High:** Re-run ALL 3 reviewers (fixes may introduce new issues in other domains). Do NOT cherry-pick reviewers.

| Iteration | Duration | Max iterations: 3 |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| 1st-3rd review | 3-5 min each | Total: ~15-20 min including fixes |

**If FAIL after 3 iterations:** STOP → Request human intervention → Document recurring pattern → Consider architectural changes → Escalate.

## Anti-Patterns

**Never:**
- Run reviewers sequentially (wastes time)
- Skip a reviewer because "domain doesn't apply"
- Proceed with Critical/High issues unfixed
- Cherry-pick which reviewers to re-run
- Argue with valid feedback without evidence
- Mark Low issues as "won't fix" without tracking

**Always:**
- Launch all 3 reviewers in single message
- Wait for all to complete before aggregating
- Fix Critical/High immediately
- Track Medium/Low with comments
- Re-run full review after fixes
- Document reviewer disagreements

## Execution Report

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | Xm Ys |
| Review Iterations | N |
| Reviewers | 3 (parallel) |
| Findings | X Critical, Y High, Z Medium, W Low |
| Fixes Applied | N |
| VERDICT | PASS/FAIL/NEEDS_DISCUSSION |
| Result | Gate passed / Returned to Gate 0 / Awaiting decision |

## Pushing Back on Reviewers

**When feedback is incorrect:** (1) Provide technical evidence (code, tests, docs) (2) Explain why implementation is correct (3) Reference requirements/architecture (4) Request clarification for ambiguous feedback (5) Security concerns need extra scrutiny before dismissing

**Example:** Reviewer says "SQL injection" → Response: "Using parameterized query on line 45: `db.Query(..., $1, userID)`. Test in auth_test.go:78 verifies."
